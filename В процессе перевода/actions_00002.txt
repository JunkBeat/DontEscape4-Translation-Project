@sidereal_elevator1=I think I see the bottom, but it's far too high to jump.

@poor_barry=Poor Barry. I have to leave him like this for now. Maybe after finding an exit there will be time to honor him.
@poor_cody=Poor Cody. I have to leave him like this for now. Maybe after finding an exit there will be time to honor him.

@cs_already_distracted=He is already distracted ... but not for long.
@cs_ammobox_1=The boxes contain a lot of different kinds of bullets. Both are far too heavy or clunky to move.
@cs_ammobox_2=It's a bit upsetting to think all these bullets will be flying in my general direction a few hours from now.
@cs_ammobox_oil=I've poured a lot of oil into the box. At least some of the bullets should fail when fired.

@cs_food_poisioned=Well, I've poisoned the food.
@cs_food_poisioned2=I don't want to take it. It's poisoned.
@cs_food_whiskey=You've gotta down that food with something, right? I hope some of those thugs have weak heads.

@restaurant_door_locked2=It's locked.

@restaurant_block_rifle=There's too many of them...
@restaurant_block_flamethrower=Yeah, and burn down the whole place I'm trying to get to in the process. No, thanks...
@restaurant_block_chemsuit=The gas is too highly concentrated. The suit won't properly protect me.

@rifle_too_loud=The rest of them will hear the gunshot...
@thug_rock=That would only knock him out briefly. Then, he'd start the alarm.
@thug_maggot=That maggot could be used to distract the guard, but not directly. Maggots don't randomly fall from the sky. It would just make him more alert, if anything...
@thug_knife=I'm neither a ninja nor a commando!
@rifle_no_ammo=It has no ammo...

@sarge_sidereal_id=Sure, I could pretend to be a member of a corporation that has destroyed the world, but I don't really want to.

@gasstation_sarge_wrench_done=I've already helped him with that.
@gasstation_sarge_shoot_not_here=He's a military man. I'd be dead before I even pull the trigger. If I really want to shoot him, I'd better go into the gas station so he doesn't see me...
@gasstation_thugs_are_there=I'd rather not go there blindly. We could take a peek safely from the inside of the shop.
@tank_canister_already=There is a gas canister here already...
@tank_canister_take_first=I should first pick it up and place it directly under the valve.

@revolver_full=The revolver is fully loaded.
@revolver_npc_ammo=I could give this to him so he can defend himself, but I should load it first.

@bear_trap_b=This trap has caught something disgusting. I need a tool of some sort to reset the spring.

@scffolding=Ouch! This metal is rusty and covered with spikes. I'm gonna cut my hands and bleed to death if I try to climb it.
@cs_buckle=This was used to pull heavy weights up and down. Maybe this could help me somehow.
@cant_reach=I can't reach that.
@cs_nomore=I've done enough killing here for now. If they detect me we will all be in serious trouble.

@fuse_short_circuit2=Damn it. Gotta be more careful.
@fuse_short_circuit3=No, not again!

@outpost_fuse_source=I can't remove it. I have to redirect the power.

@outpost_fuse_briefning_1=Looks like those wires power the electrical doormat and the elevator.
@outpost_fuse_briefning_2=The elevator line is down.

@sidereal_mixer_tray_junk3=I'll throw it away.
@sidereal_mixer_tray_full=The tray is not empty.
@sidereal_mixer_tray_wrong=Well, it doesn't look bad. However...

@sidereal_mixer_item_no_use=I could use that to retrieve the mix once it's done.
@sidereal_mixer_complete=The mixer finished its work. Let's see...

@sidereal_lab14=Lab 14. That suggests the existence of 13 more labs.
@sidereal_lab13=Lab 13. Unlike the neighbor lab, this one could be undamaged.
@sidereal_lab12=Lab 12. I wonder what they did here. Guess I'll never know.
@sidereal_lab11=Lab 11. Another mystery lost forever.

@gluegun_take_impression_2=Meanwhile, the glue gun has run out of power. I guess remote controller batteries don't last too long.
@fingerprint_no_mold=I don't want to scrape that dirt off.
@fingerprint_mold_taken=There! I have a perfect impression of this guy's fingerprint.
@locked_fingerprint=It's locked ... probably with that fingerprint-reading lock.
@fingerprint_reader1=It's a fingerprint scanner.
@fingerprint_reader2=Let's see if it recognizes me.
@fingerprint_reader3=<ACCESS DENIED>
@fingerprint_reader4=That's what I thought.
@fingerprint_reader5=Well, here goes nothing.

@outpost_ship_4=Anyway, that's our ticket out of here. Or at least that's what I hope.

@ship_toolbox_searched1=I've found a glue gun in the toolbox. It seems to be out of power.
@ship_toolbox_searched2=There is nothing interesting left in the toolbox.

@plane_covered=The entrance is covered with a whole lot of sand. I'll have to get rid of it first.
@plane_ground=That's a lot of sand. The whole nose of the plane is buried.
@plane_ground2=Digging that would definitely take too much time.

@day4_start_stairs_no=I'd better check this floor first.

@gloves_taken=There is a pair of gloves in the bag.
@gloves_taken2=There's nothing more in the bag.

@day4_no_clock=This time waiting for the evening is not a good idea. I have to find a ship and launch it before it's too late.

@heap_of_thugs=No time to bury them. I can't believe we killed them all...
@card_needed=There's a slot for an access card.
@outpost_cabinet_open=Space suits are staying here. We might need them.

@barry_give_rifle=I think I need it more than he does. Maybe if I find some other weapon...
@cord_plug_first=I should find somewhere to plug this extension cord in first before I hook it up.
@dont_attack_spider=That would be a crazy thing to do. I see a rifle on the floor, but I won't be able to pick it up while that spider is in here...

@moon_console_disk_no_power=I should restore the power first.

@too_dark=It's too dark to see anything...
@find_base_first=Good idea. Digging ditches would help with the large amount of water pouring down from the sky, but first we have to go to the Sidereal Plexus office and locate the Outpost.
@base_outside_could_dig=I could dig some ditches here to prepare for the incoming storm.

@helicopter_covered_already=The tarp covers most of the hole.
@helicopter_duct_tape=I mean, I know this duct tape seems to be endless, but come on. I can't cover the entire hole with it.
@helicopter_covered_taped=Now the tarp is held in place nicely.
@helicopter_covered_taped_already=The tarp covers most of the hole. It is held by the duct tape.
@heli_wrong_side=I should try to cover it from the outside.
@heli_cant_fix_tape=There used to be this TV show where the guy could basically repair a helicopter with just some duct tape. I miss that show.

@plates_throw=I need something that is smaller and easier to throw.

@poision_watersprayer=Poison-sprayer would be the least effective weapon I could think of.
@poision_whiskey=Wouldn't that be a crime? For all I know this could be the last bottle of whiskey on Earth.
@poision_food=It's my food. Why would I poison it?

@knife_dont_cut_it=I don't want to cut it.
@drone_smash_it=The drone is already busted. No reason to further damage it.
@not_broken=There is nothing wrong with it.
@broken_hammer_pipe=It doesn't fit.
