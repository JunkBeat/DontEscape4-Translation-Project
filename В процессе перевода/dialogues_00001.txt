@exit_caption=До скорого.
@harmless_1=Можешь перестать говорить это всем, кого мы встречаем?
@harmless_2=Ничего не могу обещать.

@ginger_intro0a_1_b=...
@ginger_intro0a_2_b=Ни с места
@ginger_intro0a_3_a=Эй, подожди, не стреляй!
@ginger_intro0a_4_a=Кто ты такая? Ты всё это время была наверху?
@ginger_intro0a_5_b=Наверху? Ты о чердаке? Нет. Я только что в него влетела.
@ginger_intro0a_6_b=То есть, я приземлилась. Аварийная посадка, так сказать. Прошу прощения, что разрушила крышу твоего дома.
@ginger_intro0a_7_a=На самом деле это не мой дом.
@ginger_intro0a_8_b=Круто. В общем, мне было не очень жаль.

@ginger_intro0b_1_b=Не двигайся!
@ginger_intro0b_2_a=Эй... расслабься, не стреляй!
@ginger_intro0b_3_a=Хорошая посадка.
@ginger_intro0b_4_b=Учитывая, что я летела до полного износа вертолёта с половиной неработающих панелей, могу сказать, что проделала неплохую работу.
@ginger_intro0b_5_a=Что ж... я рад за тебя. Жаль твой вертолёт.
@ginger_intro0b_6_b=На самом деле я его позаимствовала. Прости, я не хотела разгромить твой дом.
@ginger_intro0b_7_a=Он не совсем мой.

@ginger_intro1_1_a=Эй, может наконец опустишь оружие?
@ginger_intro1_2_a=Я не причиню тебе зла.
@ginger_intro1_3_b=Хм. Ладно... выглядишь безобидным.
@ginger_intro1_4_a=Спасибо.
@ginger_intro1_5_a=Меня зовут Дэвид.
@ginger_intro1_6_b=Кэтрин, или просто Кейт.

@ginger_intro_dejavu_1_a=Я... я тебя знаю?
@ginger_intro_dejavu_2_b=Что? Думаю нет...
@ginger_intro_dejavu_3_b=Хорошо. Странное чувство.
@ginger_intro_dejavu_4_a=Ага...
@ginger_intro_dejavu_5_b=Может, мы когда-нибудь ехали в одном поезде или автобусе, задолго до раскола Луны.
@ginger_intro_dejavu_6_b=Или что-то наподобие.
@ginger_intro_dejavu_7_a=Нет, это было что-то другое...
@ginger_intro_dejavu_8_b=Ну... ладно.

@ginger_intro_1_b=Не поможешь мне с одним делом, Дэвид?
@ginger_intro_2_a=Разве я могу сказать "нет" красотке с заряженным пистолетом в руке?
@ginger_intro_3_b=Я пытаюсь кое-куда добраться.
@ginger_intro_4_b=На территорию форпоста.
@ginger_intro_5_a=Что за форпост?
@ginger_intro_6_b=Засекреченный объект, который поможет мне покинуть это место, покинуть этот мир.
@ginger_intro_7_a=Эм.. А ты случаем не ударилась головой во время посадки?
@ginger_intro_8_b=У них есть космический корабль.
@ginger_intro_9_a=Ну да, конечно...
@ginger_intro_10_b=...
@ginger_intro_11_b=Не забывай, у меня всё ещё есть пушка.
@ginger_intro_12_a=Стой, так ты серьёзно? Космический корабль?
@ginger_intro_13_b=Да, клянусь тебе.
@ginger_intro_14_b=Sidereal Plexus. Корпорация. У них был целый космический флот.
@ginger_intro_15_b=Когда всё пошло ко дну, они эвакуировали своих лучших сотрудников и самых богатых людей на планете с помощью этих кораблей.
@ginger_intro_16_b=Я точно знаю, что один из кораблей остался на Земле. И я воспользуюсь им, чтобы спасти себя.
@ginger_intro_17_b=Если хочешь - можешь пойти со мной.
@ginger_intro_18_a=Стой, дай мне собраться с мыслями.
@ginger_intro_19_b=Слушай, пойдёшь со мной - сам всё увидишь.

@ginger_intro2_1_a=Кейт?
@ginger_intro2_2_b=Ммм?

@ginger_intro_sidereal_1_b=Мы на месте. Есть вопросы?

@ginger_about_caption=Кто ты?
@ginger_about_1_a=Я имею в виду, кто ты вообще такая?
@ginger_about_2_b=Просто девушка, пытающаяся выжить.
@ginger_about_3_a=Хорошо, ну а что насчёт корабля, форпоста и всего этого? Похоже, ты много знаешь.
@ginger_about_4_b=Слушай, я та, кто сбежит с этой лодки, прежде чем она отправится ко дну.
@ginger_about_5_b=С тобой или без тебя.

@ginger_car_caption=Машина
@ginger_car1_1_a=Там в сарае есть пикап, кстати.
@ginger_car1_2_b=Ты меня удивить пытаешься или что?
@ginger_car1_3_a=Ну... на нём мы могли бы добраться до твоего форпоста.
@ginger_car1_4_b=Да, действительно.
@ginger_car2_1_a=Но не хватает некоторых запчастей, без которых он не заведётся.
@ginger_car2_2_b=Если найдёшь всё недостающее - помогу починить.

@ginger_moon_caption=Луна
@ginger_moon_1_a=Думаешь, Луна уничтожит Землю?
@ginger_moon_2_b=Я не думаю. Я знаю.
@ginger_moon_3_b=Орбита Луны была нестабильной ещё с Происшествия.
@ginger_moon_4_a=В последнее время она становится всё больше и больше.
@ginger_moon_5_b=Да. Она врежется в Землю и всё здесь разнесёт.
@ginger_moon_6_b=Вся планета превратится в огромный шар раскалённой лавы.
@ginger_moon_7_b=И ничего не выживет - не важно, насколько прочное или глубокое будет убежище.
@ginger_moon_8_a=А когда... ?
@ginger_moon_9_b=Через три-четыре дня.
@ginger_moon_10_a=ЧТО?!
@ginger_moon_11_a=Я думал, типа, через несколько лет.
@ginger_moon_12_b=Ну прости.
@ginger_moon_13_b=Но именно поэтому нам необходимо добраться до этого корабля.

@ginger_outpost_caption=Форпост
@ginger_outpost_1_a=Так... что это за форпост?
@ginger_outpost_2_b=Небольшой исследовательский центр со стартовой площадкой для космического корабля.
@ginger_outpost_3_a=Окей, и где он?
@ginger_outpost_4_b=Без понятия.
@ginger_outpost_5_a=В смысле? Ты же хотела меня туда отвести.
@ginger_outpost_6_b=Да, но никто не говорил, что будет легко.
@ginger_outpost_7_a=Почему?
@ginger_outpost_8_b=Вся система навигации вертолёта слетела после моей посадки. Да и нет у форпоста большой неоновой вывески со стрелкой.
@ginger_outpost_9_b=На самом деле, тот факт, что это труднодоступное место, – единственная причина, по которой космический корабль всё ещё может там находиться.
@ginger_outpost_10_a=И каков план?
@ginger_outpost_11_b=Мы должны найти его... как-то.
@ginger_outpost_12_b=Для начала давай постараемся выжить.

@ginger_spaceship_caption=Корабль
@ginger_spaceship_1_a=Что насчёт корабля?
@ginger_spaceship_2_a=Типа, это как огромный ковчег, перемещающийся меж звёзд? Как в фильмах?
@ginger_spaceship_3_b=Вообще-то нет.
@ginger_spaceship_4_b=Маленький корабль, способный вывести нас на земную орбиту.
@ginger_spaceship_5_b=Но этого должно хватить.
@ginger_spaceship_6_a=А что дальше? Ну, после того, как доберёмся до орбиты.
@ginger_spaceship_7_b=Дальше... космическая станция.
@ginger_spaceship_8_a=Ты же не на ходу это придумываешь, да?
@ginger_spaceship_9_b=Клянусь, все полетели именно на эту космическую станцию.
@ginger_spaceship_10_b=Она - наша цель.
@ginger_spaceship_11_b=Но не беспокойся об этом сейчас.
@ginger_spaceship_12_b=Прежде всего нам нужно выжить.

@ginger_dreams_caption=Вчерашний сон
@ginger_dreams_1_a=Понимаю, прозвучит странно, но у меня вчера был плохой сон. И он сбылся.
@ginger_dreams_2_a=xxx
@ginger_dreams_SWARM_2_a=Рой смертоносной саранчи пролетел через эти окрестности, пожирая всё на своём пути.
@ginger_dreams_GAS_2_a=Облако смертельного газа пролетело через эти окрестности, убивая всё на своём пути.
@ginger_dreams_SPIDERS_2_a=Куча огромных пауков проходила через эти окрестности, пожирая всё на своём пути.
@ginger_dreams_3_a=Ну, сон ПОЧТИ сбылся, потому что в нём я умер. В реальности же я решил прислушаться к нему и подготовиться.
@ginger_dreams_4_b=Сон, говоришь?
@ginger_dreams_5_a=Да-да, знаю. Но я не выдумываю. Это ПРАВДА был вещий сон, он спас мне жизнь.
@ginger_dreams_6_a=А я ведь даже не верю в такие вещи. Я же не псих.
@ginger_dreams_7_b=А я верю в вещие сны.
@ginger_dreams_8_a=Правда?
@ginger_dreams_9_b=Да. Сумасшедшая ли я? Не знаю. Но думаю, что иногда сны могут направлять нас или помогать нам найти решения проблем.

@ginger_dreams2_caption=Сегодняшний сон
@ginger_dreams2_1_a=Сегодня был ещё один сон.
@ginger_dreams2_2_a=xxx
@ginger_dreams2_2_COLD=Я находился в этом доме, как вдруг стало очень холодно... смертельно холодно.
@ginger_dreams2_2_HEAT=Я находился в этом доме, как вдруг я почувствовал волну тепла. Стало так жарко, что я умер на месте.
@ginger_dreams2_3_a=Думаю, это то, что произойдёт сегодня. Согласен, очень странно звучит, но доверься мне.
@ginger_dreams2_4_b=Посмотрим, прав ли ты.

@ginger_barry_busy_caption=Отвлеки его
@ginger_barry_busy_1_a=Эй, можешь отвлечь нашего друга на секунду?
@ginger_barry_busy_2_b=Ооо, я знаю, как его отвлечь.
@ginger_barry_busy_3_a=А без пушки?
@ginger_barry_busy_4_b=Лааадно.
@ginger_barry_busy_5_b=Зануда.

@ginger_move_body1_1_a=Кейт, поможешь мне перенести тело жены Барри?
@ginger_move_body1_2_b=Да, без проблем.
@ginger_move_body1_3_a=Давай отнесём её на улицу.

@ginger_barry_talk_1_a=Хэй.
@ginger_barry_talk_2_a=Мммм.
@ginger_barry_talk_3_a=Как ты?
@ginger_barry_talk_4_b=Моя жена умерла.
@ginger_barry_talk_5_b=Ты как?
@ginger_barry_talk_6_a=Ладно, прости.
@ginger_barry_talk_7_a=Нет, серьёзно, мне правда жаль.
@ginger_barry_talk_8_a=Хочешь поговорить об этом?
@ginger_barry_talk_9_b=Нет.
@ginger_barry_talk_10_b=Я не знаю. Я не могу поверить, что это произошло.
@ginger_barry_talk_11_b=Моя дорогая, дорогая девочка.
@ginger_barry_talk_12_b=Она была такой доброй, такой хорошей. Она не заслужила смерти.
@ginger_barry_talk_13_a=Мне... мне правда жаль. Тебе, наверное, очень тяжело.
@ginger_barry_talk_14_a=...

@ginger_barry_talk_end_1_a=Мне пора.
@ginger_barry_talk_end_2_b=Ага.

@ginger_barry_caption=Насчёт Барри...
@ginger_barry1_1_a=Ты расстроена из-за Барри?
@ginger_barry1_2_b=Нет. Нисколько.
@ginger_barry1_3_a=Мне знаком этот взгляд.
@ginger_barry1_4_b=Да ладно? Как давно ты меня знаешь? Несколько часов?
@ginger_barry1_5_a=Возможно. И всё же...
@ginger_barry1_6_b=Хорошо. Барри меня раздражает. Я понимаю, утрата, но он только и говорит что о своей жене.
@ginger_barry1_7_b=Я устала от этого. У нас есть дела поважнее, чем слушать скорбящего человека.
@ginger_barry1_8_a=Это как-то не по-людски.
@ginger_barry1_9_b=У меня такой характер. Привыкай.

@ginger_barry2_1_a=Кейт?
@ginger_barry2_2_b=Что теперь, Дэвид?
@ginger_barry2_3_a=Я хотел поговорить о Барри.
@ginger_barry2_4_b=О чем тут говорить? Я ему не нравлюсь, а он не нравится мне.
@ginger_barry2_5_b=Но мы всё ещё можем работать сообща. А это крайне важно.
@ginger_barry2_6_a=Не могла бы ты вести себя более... ну, знаешь, по-человечески?
@ginger_barry2_7_b=Чего?
@ginger_barry2_8_a=Эх... ладно, проехали.

@ginger_barry3_1_a=Ты до сих пор недовольна присутствием Барри?
@ginger_barry3_2_b=Должна признать, что была слишком грубой.
@ginger_barry3_3_b=Без помощи Барри выжить было бы намного труднее.
@ginger_barry3_4_a=О, так ты оказывается умеешь признавать собственные ошибки.
@ginger_barry3_5_b=Не переходи черту, Дэвид.
@ginger_barry3_6_b=Без него мне всё равно было бы хорошо. Или без тебя.

@ginger_barry_dead_caption=Барри
@ginger_barry_dead_1_a=Бедный Барри...
@ginger_barry_dead_2_b=Да.
@ginger_barry_dead_3_a=Просто "да"? И всё?
@ginger_barry_dead_4_b=Его смерть меня печалит. Жаль, что до этого дошло.
@ginger_barry_dead_5_a=Сложно было сразу так сказать?
@ginger_barry_dead_6_b=Наверное, поэтому я и не хочу привязываться к людям. Тяжело, когда теряешь друзей.
@ginger_barry_dead_7_b=А к потере незнакомцев... можно привыкнуть.
@ginger_barry_dead_8_b=И я могу с лёгкостью пережить такую утрату.
@ginger_barry_dead_9_b=Сделай одолжение - оплакивай его за нас обоих.
@ginger_barry_dead_10_b=Пожалуйста.

@ginger_cody_caption=Насчёт Коди...
@ginger_cody1_1_a=Что ты думаешь о Коди?
@ginger_cody1_2_b=Эх, бедный ребёнок.
@ginger_cody1_3_b=То, что он прожил так долго - чудо, не иначе.

@ginger_cody2_1_a=Есть новые мысли насчёт Коди?
@ginger_cody2_2_b=Он не так уж и раздражает. Я ответила на твой вопрос?
@ginger_cody2_3_a=Ну, нет, я не это имел в виду.
@ginger_cody2_4_b=Кажется я уже говорила тебе, что считаю его бедолагой.
@ginger_cody2_5_b=Думала он затруднит наши планы, но сейчас с ним всё в порядке.
@ginger_cody2_6_b=Я чувствую, Коди меня боится.
@ginger_cody2_7_b=Может оно и к лучшему. По крайней мере, мальчишка будет слушаться.
@ginger_cody2_8_a=Ты считаешь, он не стал бы слушаться меня?
@ginger_cody2_9_b=Дэвид, пожалуйста, прекращай...

@ginger_cody3_1_a=Я размышлял о Коди и...
@ginger_cody3_2_b=Боже, Дэвид, что ты хочешь от меня услышать? Что он мне нравится?
@ginger_cody3_3_b=Хорошо, я скажу. Он мне нравится. Теперь ты доволен?
@ginger_cody3_4_a=Нуу, да. Ты до сих пор реагируешь достаточно остро, я просто хотел спросить...
@ginger_cody3_5_b=Дэвид, Коди хороший ребёнок. Понятно? И я удивляюсь, как он ещё держится.
@ginger_cody3_6_b=После всего произошедшего у взрослого человека сдала бы нервная система, а он справляется.
@ginger_cody3_7_b=Что, конечно же, заслуживает уважения.

@ginger_cody_dead_caption=Коди
@ginger_cody_dead_1_a=Я... я не справился, Кейт. Коди...
@ginger_cody_dead_2_b=Прошу, не начинай.
@ginger_cody_dead_3_a=И когда мне "начать"? Не то чтобы у нас много времени...
@ginger_cody_dead_4_b=Слушай ... Коди был...
@ginger_cody_dead_5_b=Хорошим мальчишкой.
@ginger_cody_dead_6_b=И... мне тоже его не хватает. И мне правда жаль его.
@ginger_cody_dead_7_b=Но нам нужно идти дальше.
@ginger_cody_dead_8_b=Мы уже ничего не сможем сделать.
@ginger_cody_dead_9_b=Хотя...
@ginger_cody_dead_10_a=Хотя что?
@ginger_cody_dead_11_b=Не бери в голову. Давай сконцентрируемся на выживании.

@ginger_push_trash_caption=Помоги подвинуть контейнер
@ginger_push_trash_1_a=Можешь помочь мне подвинуть этот мусорный контейнер?
@ginger_push_trash_2_b=Дэвид, ты когда-нибудь задумывался, насколько твои идеи тупые?
@ginger_push_trash_3_a=Видишь окно над дверью?
@ginger_push_trash_4_a=Я могу пролезть через него, но сначала мне нужно до него добраться.
@ginger_push_trash_5_b=Так бы сразу и сказал.
@ginger_push_trash_6_b=Я помогу, только чтобы посмотреть, как ты будешь пытаться пролезть через это маленькое окошко.

@ginger_pushed_trash_1_a=Спасибо, Кейт.
@ginger_pushed_trash_2_b=Без проблем. Теперь постарайся не сломать свои ноги, пока взбираешься.
@barry_pushed_trash_1_a=Спасибо, Барри.
@barry_pushed_trash_2_b=Не за что.

@ginger_first_exit_1_b=Идём.
@ginger_first_exit_2_b=Нам стоит подготовиться к твоему "пророчеству".
@ginger_first_exit_3_a=А что с форпостом?
@ginger_first_exit_4_b=Он... где-то там.
@ginger_first_exit_5_b=Мы продолжим искать его.

@ginger_base_comment_1_b=Хм, миленькое местечко.
@ginger_base_comment_2_a=Хочу вам напомнить, это не мой дом.
@ginger_base_comment_3_a=Я просто здесь переночевал.
@ginger_base_comment_4_a=Но убежище и правда неплохое.
@ginger_base_comment_5_b=Если мы не найдём более надёжное место, то вернёмся сюда.

@ginger_map_caption=Покажи свою карту
@ginger_map_1_a=У меня есть карта. Может она подскажет тебе, где находится форпост?
@ginger_map_2_b=Хмм... боюсь, что нет.
@ginger_map_3_b=Но...
@ginger_map_4_a=Что?
@ginger_map_5_b=Пока я пролетала неподалёку, я заметила пару интересных мест.
@ginger_map_6_b=Давай я отмечу их.

@ginger_map_view_1=Так... давай посмотрим.
@ginger_map_view_2=К западу точно был ресторан.
@ginger_map_view_3=А вот здесь был какой-то дом. Думаю, там кто-то всё ещё живёт.
@ginger_map_view_4=Будем надеяться, что эта информация нам пригодится.

@ginger_give_coat_caption=Возьми пальто
@ginger_give_coat_1_a=Вот, возьми пальто.
@ginger_give_coat_2_b=Ооо, не стоило.
@ginger_give_coat_3_a=Надень его, когда похолодает.
@ginger_give_coat_4_b=Я поняла. Спасибо.

@ginger_already_coat_caption=Возьми пальто
@ginger_already_coat_1_a=Вот, возьми пальто.
@ginger_already_coat_2_b=У меня уже есть.
@ginger_already_coat_3_b=Или ты хочешь отдавать мне каждое пальто, которое найдёшь?
@ginger_already_coat_4_a=Забудь...

@ginger_bad_coat_caption=Возьми пальто
@ginger_bad_coat_1_a=Вот, возьми пальто.
@ginger_bad_coat_2_b=Ты шутишь, да?
@ginger_bad_coat_3_b=Скоро здесь будет лютая жара, и ты хочешь, чтобы я надела ЭТО?
@ginger_bad_coat_4_a=Нет, я...
@ginger_bad_coat_5_a=Я думал, что тебе пойдёт.
@ginger_bad_coat_6_b=Боже, Дэвид, хватит.

@ginger_bad2_coat_caption=Возьми пальто
@ginger_bad2_coat_1_a=Вот, возьми пальто.
@ginger_bad2_coat_2_b=Зачем?
@ginger_bad2_coat_3_a=Ну, я думал, тебе понравится.
@ginger_bad2_coat_4_b=Что ж... ты был не прав. Но спасибо.

@ginger_give_water_caption=Возьми бутылку воды
@ginger_give_water_1_a=Вот немного воды.
@ginger_give_water_2_b=А? Хорошо, но я не очень хочу пить.
@ginger_give_water_3_a=Оставь на потом. На случай жажды.
@ginger_give_water_4_b=Я поняла. Спасибо

@ginger_already_water_caption=Возьми бутылку воды
@ginger_already_water_1_a=Вот немного воды.
@ginger_already_water_2_b=У меня уже есть бутылка.
@ginger_already_water_3_b=Или ты собираешься отдавать мне каждую найденную бутылку?
@ginger_already_water_4_a=Забудь...

@ginger_bad_water_caption=Возьми бутылку воды
@ginger_bad_water_1_a=Вот немного воды.
@ginger_bad_water_2_b=Нет, спасибо.
@ginger_bad_water_3_b=Может, сам выпьешь?

@ginger_bad2_water_caption=Возьми бутылку воды
@ginger_bad2_water_1_a=Хочешь немного воды?
@ginger_bad2_water_2_b=Нет, спасибо.

@ginger_exit_1_a=Поговорим позже.
@ginger_exit_2_b=Не сомневаюсь.

@crashsite_tracks_1_a=Этих следов вчера здесь не было.
@crashsite_tracks_2_b=Дальше дорога перекрыта.
@crashsite_tracks_3_b=Может, кто-то пытался объехать место аварии?
@crashsite_tracks_4_a=Возможно.
@crashsite_tracks_5_b=Давай посмотрим, куда нас приведут следы.
@crashsite_tracks_6_a=Это мой девиз по жизни.

@rv_encounter_1_a=Похоже, поездка выдалась так себе...
@rv_encounter_2_a=Интересно, что произошло.
@rv_encounter_3_b=Думаю, их машина просто сломалась.
@rv_encounter_4_b=Фургон - не лучший вариант для путешествий по бездорожью.
@rv_encounter_5_a=Они организовали лагерь, и...

@rv_encounter_6_a=Рой саранчи добрался до них.
@rv_encounter_7_a=Ядовитое облако настигло их.
@rv_encounter_8_a=Пауки нашли их.

@chimney_dont_want_1_a=Что... что ты делаешь?
@chimney_dont_want_2_b=Хм, не знаю.
@chimney_dont_want_3_b=Пытаюсь разжечь камин?
@chimney_dont_want_4_a=Буду честна - отвратительная идея.
@chimney_dont_want_5_a=Уже и так достаточно тепло.
@chimney_dont_want_6_a=Нам необходимо СНИЗИТЬ температуру.
@chimney_dont_want_7_b=Да, ты права... о чём я только думал.
@chimney_dont_want_8_a=Наверное твой мозг просто перегрелся.
@chimney_dont_want_9_b=Ха-ха.

@ginger_roof_save_them_1_b=Коди! Барри!
@ginger_roof_save_them_2_b=Помоги им, Дэвид! Долго они так не протянут!
@ginger_roof_save_barry_1_b=Барри!
@ginger_roof_save_barry_2_b=Помоги ему, Дэвид! Долго он так не протянет!
@ginger_roof_save_cody_1_b=Коди!
@ginger_roof_save_cody_2_b=Помоги ему, Дэвид! Долго он так не протянет!

@ginger_sidereal_arrival_intro_1_b=Вот мы и пришли...
@ginger_sidereal_arrival_intro_2_b=Вопросы?

@ginger_sidereal_arrival_outpost_caption=Это не тот форпост, о котором ты говорила, да?
@ginger_sidereal_arrival_outpost_1_a=Это не тот форпост, о котором ты говорила, да?
@ginger_sidereal_arrival_outpost_2_b=Ты меня вообще слушал?
@ginger_sidereal_arrival_outpost_3_b=Конечно же это не тот форпост. Здесь нет ни пусковой площадки, ни самого корабля.
@ginger_sidereal_arrival_outpost_4_b=Это... ну, это просто офис.

@ginger_sidereal_arrival_docs_caption=Зачем мы сюда пришли?
@ginger_sidereal_arrival_docs_1_a=Ну и зачем мы сюда пришли?
@ginger_sidereal_arrival_docs_2_b=Координаты. Нам нужно узнать местоположение пусковой площадки.
@ginger_sidereal_arrival_docs_3_b=Бумаги, карты - прошерстить надо всё. Я уверена, что мы найдём здесь что-то полезное.

@ginger_sidereal_connections1_caption=Какое отношение ты имеешь к Sidereal Plexus?
@ginger_sidereal_connections1_1_a=Какое отношение ты имеешь к Sidereal Plexus?
@ginger_sidereal_connections1_2_b=Я... понятия не имею, о чём ты говоришь.
@ginger_sidereal_connections1_3_a=Откуда ты вообще знаешь о существовании столь секретного корабля?
@ginger_sidereal_connections1_4_b=Долгая история, давай поговорим об этом позже.

@ginger_sidereal_exit_1_a=Вопросов больше нет.
@ginger_sidereal_exit_2_b=Тогда идём.

@ginger_sidereal_cody_mourn_1_b=...
@ginger_sidereal_cody_mourn_2_b=Коди...
@ginger_sidereal_cody_mourn_3_b=Мне... мне жаль, Дэвид...
@ginger_sidereal_cody_mourn_4_b=Бедный мальчик...

@ginger_sidereal_barry_mourn_1_b=...
@ginger_sidereal_barry_mourn_2_b=Барри...
@ginger_sidereal_barry_mourn_3_b=Мне... мне жаль, Дэвид...
@ginger_sidereal_barry_mourn_4_b=Бедняга...

@ginger_give_gun_1_a=Вот, может пригодиться.
@ginger_give_gun_2_b=Спасибо, но пистолет у меня уже есть, помнишь?
@ginger_give_gun_3_a=Точно.

@npc2_block_house1_1_b=Стой. Не подходи к этому дому.
@npc2_block_house1_2_a=Почему?
@npc2_block_house1_3_b=Потому что он мой. Уходи.

@npc2_block_house2_1_b=Сказал же, к дому не приближаться.
@npc2_block_house2_2_a=Прости.
@npc2_block_house2_3_b=Прошу, уйди

@npc2_block_house3_1_b=Пошли прочь!
@npc2_block_house3_2_a=Ой.
@npc2_block_house3_3_c=Дэвид, не проще ему задницу надрать?
@npc2_block_house3_4_a=Это не в моём стиле.

@npc2_block_house4_1_b=Пожалуйста, уйди.

@npc2_intro1_1_a=Привет.
@npc2_intro1_2_b=Прошу, уйди. Просто... оставь меня в покое.
@npc2_intro1_3_a=Я не причиню тебе зла.
@npc2_intro1_4_c=Да, он практически безобидный.
@npc2_intro1_5_a=Кейт, завязывай...
@npc2_intro1_6_a=Меня зовут Дэвид.
@npc2_intro1_6_extra_a=А вон того мальчишку - Коди.
@npc2_intro1_7_a=Выглядишь неважно. Что стряслось?
@npc2_intro1_8_b=Я Барри.
@npc2_intro1_9_b=Всё дело в моей жене.
@npc2_intro1_10_b=Она...
@npc2_intro1_11_b=Она больше не проснётся.
@npc2_intro1_12_b=Прошлой ночью она... погибла. За что... Боже, за что? Почему она? Почему не я?
@npc2_intro1_13_b=На её месте должен был быть я...
@npc2_intro1_14_b=Её тело всё ещё в доме.
@npc2_intro1_15_b=Я не знаю, что мне теперь делать.
@npc2_intro1_16_a=...
@npc2_intro1_17_c=Идём, Дэвид. У него и так полно проблем.
@npc2_intro1_18_a=Стой... Барри.
@npc2_intro1_19_b=Что тебе нужно?

@npc2_intro3_1_a=Мы знакомы?
@npc2_intro3_2_b=Я не...
@npc2_intro3_3_b=Погоди...
@npc2_intro3_4_b=Мы случайно не пересекались на заправке, пока конец света не наступил?
@npc2_intro3_5_a=Что происходит, Кейт? Почему я до сих пор испытываю чувство дежавю?
@npc2_intro3_6_c=Может, сны..?
@npc2_intro3_7_a=Нет... ну, то есть, да. Но, мне кажется, что причина в чём-то ещё.
@npc2_intro3_8_b=Ну, кем бы ты ни был, чего хочешь?

@npc2_intro2_1_a=Хэй.
@npc2_intro2_2_b=Да?

@npc2_wife_caption=Расскажи о своей жене
@npc2_wife_1_a=Расскажи мне о своей жене.
@npc2_wife_2_b=Она была самой доброй и прекрасной женщиной, которую мне довелось встретить.
@npc2_wife_3_b=Для меня она была всем. А теперь её нет.
@npc2_wife_4_b=Я подвёл её... не смог защитить.
@npc2_wife_5_b=На её месте должен был оказаться я.

@npc2_moon_caption=Луна
@npc2_moon_1_a=Ты заметил, что Луна становится всё больше?
@npc2_moon_2_b=Да.
@npc2_moon_3_b=Полагаю, наши дни сочтены.
@npc2_moon_4_a=Это так. Но я не собираюсь сдаваться без боя.
@npc2_moon_5_b=Удачи.

@npc2_come_caption=Идём с нами
@npc2_come_1_a=Оставаться здесь - плохая идея.
@npc2_come_2_a=Температура ночью будет бешеной.
@npc2_come_3_a=Идём с нами, вместе у нас больше шансов выжить.
@npc2_come_4_b=Прости, но я не вижу в этом смысла. Лучше я останусь здесь и дождусь своей смерти.
@npc2_come_5_b=Так я хотя бы снова увижу свою жену.

@npc2_come2_caption=Твоя жена хотела бы, чтобы ты продолжал жить
@npc2_come2_1_a=Уверен, твоя жена хотела бы, чтобы ты продолжал жить.
@npc2_come2_2_a=Ты должен хранить память о ней, ведь если не ты, то кто?
@npc2_come2_3_b=Какая тебе разница, умру я или нет?
@npc2_come2_4_b=Мы даже не знакомы.
@npc2_come2_5_a=Это так. Но если мы будем держаться вместе - наши шансы на выживание повысятся.
@npc2_come2_6_b=Я... я не могу бросить свою жену.

@npc2_burial_caption=Похороны
@npc2_burial_1_a=Твоя жена заслуживает полноценных похорон.
@npc2_burial_2_b=Я... я не могу смотреть на её бездыханное тело.
@npc2_burial_3_b=Безжизненное... холодное...
@npc2_burial_4_a=Я могу устроить похороны.
@npc2_burial_5_c=Что? Дэвид, ты серьёзно? У нас нет на это времени.
@npc2_burial_6_a=Слушай, этот мужчина потерял в своей жизни всё. Прояви хоть каплю уважения.
@npc2_burial_7_a=Я не прошу твоей помощи. Просто хотя бы не пытайся меня остановить.
@npc2_burial_8_c=Эх, ладно, я помогу.
@npc2_burial_9_c=Буду надеяться, что мы не потеряем много времени.
@npc2_burial_10_a=У тебя есть лопата, Барри?
@npc2_burial_11_b=А? Да... да. Вот она, прямо здесь.

@npc2_burialz_1_b=Прошу.
@npc2_burialz_2_a=Спасибо.

@npc2_ship_caption=Космический корабль
@npc2_ship_1_a=В общем, наш план таков: найти космический корабль и улететь отсюда.
@npc2_ship_2_b=Космический. Корабль.
@npc2_ship_3_a=Да, знаю, звучит безумно.
@npc2_ship_4_a=Но мы сейчас буквально окружены безумием.
@npc2_ship_5_b=Это план Кейт, не так ли?
@npc2_ship_6_a=Да.
@npc2_ship_7_b=И что ты о нём думаешь?
@npc2_ship_8_a=Не знаю. Поверить в него трудно, но это наша единственная надежда.
@npc2_ship_9_b=Терять нам уже нечего, так ведь?

@npc2_ginger_caption=Насчёт Кейт...
@npc2_ginger1_1_a=Что ты думаешь о Кейт?
@npc2_ginger1_2_c=Не могу точно сказать. Она выглядит скрытной.
@npc2_ginger1_3_b=Вы же понимаете, что я стою в нескольких шагах от вас?

@npc2_ginger2_1_a=Появились новые мысли насчёт Кейт?
@npc2_ginger2_2_c=Без понятия, Дэвид. Вся эта затея, Sidereal Plexus...
@npc2_ginger2_3_c=Чувство такое, словно Кейт притворяется глупышкой. Она говорит сперва одно, потом другое.
@npc2_ginger2_4_c=Причём с самого начала она многое о них знала.
@npc2_ginger2_5_c=Не говоря уже про идею с космическим кораблём.
@npc2_ginger2_6_c=Разве не подозрительно?

@npc2_ginger3_1_a=Что думаешь о текущей ситуации.. и о Кейт?
@npc2_ginger3_2_c=У неё одни недостатки, у нас - другие.
@npc2_ginger3_3_c=Вначале меня терзали сомнения. Но Кейт нас ещё не подставила, несмотря на кучу таких возможностей.
@npc2_ginger3_4_c=Может, мы ей просто нужны для достижения собственной цели? Так или иначе, как говорила Мэгги, людям нужно давать шанс.
@npc2_ginger3_5_c=И, ладно, допустим я доверяю Кейт. Как минимум, не думаю, что она причинит нам вред.
@npc2_ginger3_6_c=Но не пойми меня неправильно. Я уверен, потеряв кого-нибудь из нас, она точно не стала бы рыдать.

@npc2_ginger_dead_1_a=Не могу поверить, её больше нет с нами.
@npc2_ginger_dead_2_c=Даа..
@npc2_ginger_dead_3_c=Она не раз называла себя "девушкой, которая умеет выживать".
@npc2_ginger_dead_4_a=Похоже, она была не права.
@npc2_ginger_dead_5_c=Досадно.
@npc2_ginger_dead_6_c=Кейт проделала большой путь, чтобы привести нас сюда, и поплатилась жизнью.
@npc2_ginger_dead_7_c=Как-то несправедливо.

@npc2_cody_caption=Насчёт Коди...
@npc2_cody1_1_a=Что думаешь о Коди?
@npc2_cody1_2_b=Бедный мальчик. Совсем один.
@npc2_cody1_3_a=Насколько я понимаю, он сирота.
@npc2_cody1_4_b=И то, что он так много прожил - это, наверное, чудо.
@npc2_cody1_5_b=Без родителей, посреди безумия, окружающего Землю.
@npc2_cody1_6_b=Жить ему было нелегко.
@npc2_cody1_7_b=Надеюсь, всё изменится в лучшую сторону.
@npc2_cody1_8_b=Дэвид, береги этого мальчика.

@npc2_cody2_1_a=Что-то не так с Коди? Ты всегда смотришь на него.
@npc2_cody2_2_b=Наверное я ему завидую.
@npc2_cody2_3_b=Он как-будто потерял... всё, что только мог. Жил без семьи, друзей, близких, и решил присоединиться к группе незнакомцев,
@npc2_cody2_4_b=понимающих, как долго он пребывал в одиночестве до их появления.
@npc2_cody2_5_b=Просто посмотри на него: улыбчивый, весёлый и резвый. Даже когда мир вокруг него погибает.
@npc2_cody2_6_b=Я бы хотел быть таким же.
@npc2_cody2_7_a=Аналогично.

@npc2_cody3_1_a=По-твоему, всё ли хорошо у Коди?
@npc2_cody3_2_b=Более чем. При сложившихся обстоятельствах его можно назвать невероятно выносливым ребёнком.
@npc2_cody3_3_b=С виду он просто беспомощный мальчик. Но, честно говоря, он будто бы продлевает нам жизнь своим позитивным настроем, своей детской уверенностью в том, что всё будет хорошо, надеждами на лучшее.
@npc2_cody3_4_b=Без этого я бы вряд ли смог двигаться дальше. Мне нужен был такой импульс. Другими словами, малой дал мне пинок под зад.
@npc2_cody3_5_c=Я могу надрать кому-нибудь задницу!
@npc2_cody3_6_b=Следи за языком, молодой человек!
@npc2_cody3_7_c=Извините! Я хотел сказать.. "могу дать по булкам".
@npc2_cody3_8_b=Ещё одно подобное слово, и ты отхватишь от меня леща!

@npc2_exit_1_a=Пока что на этом всё.

@npc2_burial2_caption=Захоронение
@npc2_burial2_1_a=Ну же.
@npc2_burial2_2_a=Пора.
@npc2_burial2_3_b=Хорошо...

@npc2_burial3_caption=Захоронение
@npc2_burial3_1_b=Спасибо. Она этого заслуживает.
@npc2_burial3_2_a=Да, конечно.
@npc2_burial3_3_a=Давай, Барри. Пойдём.
@npc2_burial3_4_b=Куда?
@npc2_burial3_5_a=У нас есть что-то вроде плана.
@npc2_burial3_6_a=И первая его часть - выжить сегодняшней ночью.
@npc2_burial3_7_b=Ладно.
@npc2_burial3_8_b=Ради неё.

@npc2_locket_caption=Медальон твоей жены
@npc2_locket_1_a=Это принадлежит твоей жене. Тебе стоит заглянуть внутрь и...
@npc2_locket_2_b=Где ты его нашёл?
@npc2_locket_3_a=Эмм.. кажется внутри есть записка.
@npc2_locket_4_b= ГДЕ. ^  ТЫ. ^ ЕГО. ^НАШЁЛ?
@npc2_locket_5_a=Послушай, я...
@npc2_locket_6_a=Внутри лежит записка... Тебе стоит прочесть её.
@npc2_locket_7_b=ТЫ ПРОБРАЛСЯ В МОЙ ДОМ И ПРИКАСАЛСЯ К МОЕЙ ЖЕНЕ?!
@npc2_locket_8_c=Прекратите!
@npc2_locket_9_b=Я ПРАВ?!
@npc2_locket_10_a=Барри, погоди!
@npc2_locket_11_c=ПРЕКРАТИТЕ!
@npc2_locket_12_b=А ещё ковырялся в её вещах, как в МУСОРЕ?! Считай, что ты УЖЕ труп!!!
@npc2_locket_13_c=Я ВЫСТРЕЛЮ В ТЕБЯ!
@npc2_locket_14_a=НЕТ! СТОЙ!
@npc2_locket_15_a=Барри... просто прочитай чёртову записку!!!
@npc2_locket_16_a=Давай, пожалуйста, просто.. прочитай.
@npc2_locket_17_b=...
@npc2_locket_18_b=Моя дорогая девочка...
@npc2_locket_19_b=Моя сладкая...
@npc2_locket_20_b=Почему ты...
@npc2_locket_21_a=Я не хотел брать медальон, но подумал, что тебе он необходим.
@npc2_locket_22_b=Нет, нет... Мне жаль.
@npc2_locket_23_b=Зря я так вскипел.
@npc2_locket_24_b=Если бы не ты, я бы наверное никогда не увидел последние слова жены.
@npc2_locket_25_b=Записка точно написана её почерком, но... когда она успела это написать? Как она могла знать?
@npc2_locket_26_c=Иногда люди могут... предвидеть события, до того как они произойдут. Верно, Дэвид?
@npc2_locket_27_b=Я словно читаю прощальное письмо, которое мне доставили.
@npc2_locket_28_b=Спасибо.

@npc2_locket_CODY_c=ПЕРЕСТАНЬТЕ КРИЧАТЬ!

@npc2_push_trash_caption=Помоги передвинуть контейнер
@npc2_push_trash_1_a=Не поможешь мне передвинуть мусорный контейнер?
@npc2_push_trash_2_b=Эм... да, конечно.
@npc2_push_trash_3_a=Спасибо!

@npc2_give_coat_caption=Возьми пальто
@npc2_give_coat_1_a=Эй, возьми пальто.
@npc2_give_coat_2_b=Хм, хорошо. Уже становится прохладно.
@npc2_give_coat_3_a=Ага. Дальше будет только хуже.
@npc2_give_coat_4_b=Благодарю.

@npc2_cody_coat_caption=Возьми пальто
@npc2_cody_coat_1_a=Эй, возьми пальто.
@npc2_cody_coat_2_b=Спасибо, но.. лучше отдай его Коди.
@npc2_cody_coat_3_c=А? Вы меня звали?
@npc2_cody_coat_4_a=А что насчёт тебя, Барри?
@npc2_cody_coat_5_b=Со мной всё будет в порядке. Мы найдём ещё пару штук.

@npc2_already_coat_caption=Возьми пальто
@npc2_already_coat_1_a=Эй, возьми пальто.
@npc2_already_coat_2_b=Спасибо, но у меня уже есть. Оставь его себе.

@npc2_bad_coat_caption=Возьми пальто
@npc2_bad_coat_1_a=Эй, возьми пальто.
@npc2_bad_coat_2_b=Хм, сейчас так жарко. Боюсь представить, что будет дальше.
@npc2_bad_coat_3_b=Пальто - это не очень хорошая идея.
@npc2_bad_coat_4_a=Даа, действительно.

@npc2_bad2_coat_caption=Возьми пальто
@npc2_bad2_coat_1_a=Вот, возьми пальто.
@npc2_bad2_coat_2_b=Спасибо, но мне это не нужно.

@npc2_give_water_caption=Возьми бутылку воды
@npc2_give_water_1_a=Эй, хочешь немного воды?
@npc2_give_water_2_a=Пригодится в жару и поможет справиться с обезвоживанием.
@npc2_give_water_3_b=Хорошо. Становится действительно жарко.
@npc2_give_water_4_a=Ага. Температура продолжает набирать обороты.
@npc2_give_water_5_b=Спасибо.

@npc2_cody_water_caption=Возьми бутылку воды
@npc2_cody_water_1_a=Эй, хочешь немного воды?
@npc2_cody_water_2_b=Спасибо, но... лучше отдай её Коди.
@npc2_cody_water_3_c=А? Меня кто-то звал?
@npc2_cody_water_4_a=Но что насчёт тебя, Барри?
@npc2_cody_water_5_b=Не переживай за меня.

@npc2_already_water_caption=Возьми бутылку воды
@npc2_already_water_1_a=Эй, хочешь немного воды?
@npc2_already_water_2_b=Спасибо, но у меня уже есть бутылка. Оставь её себе.

@npc2_bad_water_caption=Возьми бутылку воды
@npc2_bad_water_1_a=Эй, хочешь немного воды?
@npc2_bad_water_2_b=Спасибо, я не слишком хочу пить.
@npc2_bad_water_3_b=Может, лучше поискать что-нибудь тёплое.
@npc2_bad_water_4_a=Да, действительно.

@npc2_bad2_water_caption=Возьми бутылку воды
@npc2_bad2_water_1_a=Эй, хочешь немного воды?
@npc2_bad2_water_2_b=Спасибо, я не слишком хочу пить.

@npc2_push_pipe_caption=Поможешь мне с трубой?
@npc2_push_pipe_1_a=Барри, поможешь мне кое с чем?
@npc2_push_pipe_2_b=А именно?
@npc2_push_pipe_3_a=Труба преграждает дорогу. Но сам я не смогу её передвинуть.
@npc2_push_pipe_4_b=Да, хорошо. Попробуем вместе.
@npc2_push_pipe_5_a=Спасибо, Барри.
@npc2_push_pipe_6_b=Не благодари.

@barry_cody_dead_caption=Коди
@barry_cody_dead_1_a=Не могу перестать думать о Коди.
@barry_cody_dead_2_a=И о том, как я его потерял.
@barry_cody_dead_3_b=Не бери вину на себя. Иногда всё идёт не по плану.
@barry_cody_dead_4_b=...
@barry_cody_dead_day2=Температура оказалась для него слишком суровой.
@barry_cody_dead_sidereal=Но всё же, тебе не стоило делать выбор в мою пользу.
@barry_cody_dead_5_b=На его месте должен был быть я.
@barry_cody_dead_6_a=Прекрати такое говорить.
@barry_cody_dead_7_b=Будем надеяться, что он теперь в лучшем мире.

@house_b_inside_rubble_1_a=Вторая часть дома обрушилась. Не осталось ничего, кроме груды обломков...

@house_b_painting_1_a=Маяк на берегу моря. Небо тёмное, а море кажется глубоким и холодным, пенистые волны омывают песок вокруг неосвещённого маяком участка.
@house_b_painting_2_a=Мне становится не по себе от этой картины.

@npc2_give_gun_1_a=Возьми пистолет
@npc2_give_gun_2_b=Пистолет.
@npc2_give_gun_3_a=Знаешь, как им пользоваться?
@npc2_give_gun_4_b=Да, всё просто... я бы НЕ использовал его.
@npc2_give_gun_5_a=И я тоже.
@npc2_give_gun_6_a=Но порою жизнь не оставляет другого выхода.
@npc2_give_gun_7_b=Спасибо, Дэвид. Я воспользуюсь им, если всё остальное не поможет.

@cody_intro1_1_b=Уходите! Я первый нашёл эту бургерную.
@cody_intro1_2_b=Предупреждаю, я умею драться!
@cody_intro1_3_a=Успокойся, мы не собираемся делать тебе больно.
@cody_intro1_4_c=Да, он парень довольно безобидный.
@cody_intro1_5_b=Ладно. Но всё равно, я вас не боюсь!
@cody_intro1_6_a=Меня зовут Дэвид. Это Кейт.
@cody_intro1_6_extra_a=А это Барри.

@cody_intro2a_1_a=Как тебя зовут?
@cody_intro2a_2_b=Коди. А теперь убирайтесь, иначе... !

@cody_intro2b_1_a=Спокойно, Коди. Мы пришли сюда не из плохих намерений.
@cody_intro2b_2_b=Откуда ты знаешь моё имя?
@cody_intro2b_3_a=Ну... просто совпадение. Сказал первое имя, которое пришло на ум.
@cody_intro2b_4_b=Не приближайтесь! Я вас не знаю.
@cody_intro2b_5_b=Наверное.
@cody_intro2b_6_b=Убирайтесь, иначе... !

@cody_intro2_1_b=Стоять! Не приближайтесь!
@cody_intro2_2_b=Уходите отсюда!

@cody_intro2c_1_b=Эм... вы уже нашли какую-нибудь еду?

@cody_intro3_1_a=Привет.

@cody_orwhat_caption=Иначе что... ?
@cody_orwhat_1_a=Убирайтесь, иначе что?
@cody_orwhat_2_b=Иначе я вас побью.
@cody_orwhat_3_a=О, нет.
@cody_orwhat_4_b=Да! Так что вам лучше уйти!
@cody_orwhat_5_b=Пожалуйста.

@cody_parents_caption=Твои родители
@cody_parents_1_a=Где твои родители?
@cody_parents_2_b=...
@cody_parents_3_b=Нигде.
@cody_parents_4_b=Я сам по себе.
@cody_parents_5_c=Мне так жаль...
@cody_parents_6_b=Не стоит. Я всегда жил в одиночестве.
@cody_parents_7_b=И знаю как о себе позаботиться.

@cody_door_closed_caption=Что находится за этой дверью?
@cody_door_closed_1_a=Ты так настойчиво пытаешься открыть дверь.
@cody_door_closed_2_a=Что за ней находится?
@cody_door_closed_3_b=Включи свой мозг, тупица. Это вообще-то ресторан, понятное дело.
@cody_door_closed_4_a=Надеешься там обнаружить немного еды?
@cody_door_closed_5_b=Ну конечно!
@cody_door_closed_7_b=Дверь закрыта. Ресторан никто не грабил. Еда точно должна быть, я отвечаю.
@cody_door_closed_8_a=И она ещё не испортилась?
@cody_door_closed_9_c=Бедняга. Когда ты в последний раз ел?
@cody_door_closed_10_b=Не твоего ума дело.
@cody_door_closed_11_a=Если подумать, вчера я ничего не ел.
@cody_door_closed_12_b=ВИДИШЬ? Ты тоже пришёл сюда за едой!
@cody_door_closed_13_a=Вообще-то нет.
@cody_door_closed_14_b=Да.
@cody_door_closed_15_a=Нет, я...
@cody_door_closed_16_a=Не важно.

@cody_come_caption=Пойдём с нами.
@cody_come_1_a=Присоединяйся к нам.
@cody_come_2_a=Ночью погода станет очень опасной.
@cody_come_3_a=С нами у тебя больше шансов на выживание.
@cody_come_4_b=А еда у вас есть?
@cody_come_5_a=Возможно...?
@cody_come_6_b=Тогда ВОЗМОЖНО я пойду с вами.
@cody_come_7_b=Если у вас нет еды, то я и сам выжить смогу.

@cody_age_caption=Сколько тебе лет?
@cody_age_1_a=Эй, малой, сколько тебе лет?
@cody_age_2_b=Я не малой, понятно? Мне уже двенадцать.
@cody_age_3_c=Неужели?
@cody_age_4_b=Ладно, мне десять. Ну и что?! Я способен сам о себе позаботиться!
@cody_age_5_c=Никто не сомневается.

@cody_door_opened_intro_1_a=Привет.
@cody_door_opened_intro_2_b=Как... как ты пробрался туда?!

@cody_door_opened_owner_caption=Я владелец этого ресторана.
@cody_door_opened_owner_1_a=Я владелец этого ресторана.
@cody_door_opened_owner_2_b=Правда?
@cody_door_opened_owner_3_a=Конечно.
@cody_door_opened_owner_4_b=Ты только не подумай, я не вор.
@cody_door_opened_owner_5_a=Ну не знаю, я буду внимательно следить за тобой.
@cody_door_opened_owner_6_b=Ммм, ладно. А твой ресторан сейчас случайно не открыт?
@cody_door_opened_owner_7_a=Боюсь, что нет.

@cody_door_opened_magic_caption=Я волшебник.
@cody_door_opened_magic_1_a=Я волшебник и умею телепортироваться.
@cody_door_opened_magic_2_b=Правда?
@cody_door_opened_magic_3_a=Конечно.
@cody_door_opened_magic_4_b=Ну а я тебе не верю.
@cody_door_opened_magic_5_b=Докажи. Телепортируйся к тому окну.
@cody_door_opened_magic_6_a=Не могу. У меня... эээ... кончилась мана.

@cody_door_opened_backdoor_caption=Я использовал запасной выход.
@cody_door_opened_backdoor_1_a=Я использовал запасной выход.
@cody_door_opened_backdoor_2_b=А, а я и не знал, что здесь был запасной выход.
@cody_door_opened_backdoor_3_a=Ну, скорее, запасное окно.
@cody_door_opened_backdoor_4_b=Ничего себе! Ты прямо как настоящий грабитель.
@cody_door_opened_backdoor_5_a=Да ну. Место всё равно заброшено.
@cody_door_opened_backdoor_6_a=И вообще, почему я перед тобой оправдываюсь?

@cody_door_opened_twin_caption=Я брат-близнец Дэвида.
@cody_door_opened_twin_1_a=А? Ты о чём?
@cody_door_opened_twin_2_a=Я впервые тебя вижу.
@cody_door_opened_twin_3_b=Но я ведь недавно говорил с тобой!
@cody_door_opened_twin_4_a=Ты наверное перепутал меня с моим братом-близнецом, Дэвидом.
@cody_door_opened_twin_5_b=...
@cody_door_opened_twin_6_b=Ха-ха. Серьёзно?
@cody_door_opened_twin_7_b=Ты же шутишь, да?

@cody_food_locked_1_a=Держи.
@cody_food_locked_2_b=Что? Это же... ?
@cody_food_locked_3_b=Еда!
@cody_food_locked_4_b=Но... эмм... как её открыть?
@cody_food_locked_5_c=И ты говоришь, что умеешь заботиться о себе...
@cody_food_locked_6_a=Хм, давай сюда. Я попробую открыть её.
@cody_food_locked_7_b=Кушать хочется...

@cody_food_1_a=Держи.
@cody_food_2_b=Что? Это же... ?
@cody_food_3_b=Еда!
@cody_food_4_b=Вау! Ты хороший человек.
@cody_food_5_c=Я бы так не говорила. Скорее неуклюжий и добрячок.
@cody_food_6_a=Пойдём, Коди. С нами ты будешь в безопасности.
@cody_food_7_a=Возможно у нас найдётся ещё больше еды.
@cody_food_8_b=Круто!

@cody_moon_caption=Луна
@cody_moon_1_a=Ты заметил, что Луна каждый день увеличивается?
@cody_moon_2_b=Не может быть. Ты точно в этом уверен?
@cody_moon_3_a=Да.
@cody_moon_4_b=И... почему это происходит?
@cody_moon_5_a=Луна опускается. Прямо на нас.
@cody_moon_6_b=Чтоооо?
@cody_moon_7_b=Но... мы же от этого не пострадаем?
@cody_moon_8_a=Не факт.
@cody_moon_9_c=Дэвид, не пугай меня.
@cody_moon_10_b=Насколько сильно...?
@cody_moon_11_c=С нами всё будет в порядке, Коди.

@cody_barry_caption=Насчёт Барри...
@cody_barry1_1_a=Что ты думаешь о Барри?
@cody_barry1_2_c=Не знаю. Он хороший,
@cody_barry1_3_c=но с виду какой-то грустный.
@cody_barry1_4_a=Дело в том, что он потерял свою жену.
@cody_barry1_5_c=Я бы хотел взбодрить его, подарить ему что-то...
@cody_barry1_6_c=Но у меня ничего нет.
@cody_barry1_7_a=Давай просто составим ему компанию.
@cody_barry1_8_c=И этого будет достаточно?
@cody_barry1_9_a=Думаю, да!

@cody_barry2_1_a=Ты поменял своё мнение насчёт Барри?
@cody_barry2_2_c=Пока не могу сказать. Он всё ещё грустный.
@cody_barry2_3_a=Пережить такую утрату нелегко.
@cody_barry2_4_c=Знаю. Я пытаюсь поднять ему настроение, и, кажется, сегодня я видел, как он улыбается.
@cody_barry2_5_c=Люди должны чаще улыбаться. Тогда всё People should smile more often. Everything is better then.
@cody_barry2_6_a=When you put it that way it doesn't sound too complicated.
@cody_barry2_7_c=Of course it doesn't! You make it complicated!
@cody_barry2_8_c=All adults do.

@cody_barry3_1_a=I think you and Barry are getting along.
@cody_barry3_2_c=Он клёвый!
@cody_barry3_3_c=То есть, он постоянно заботится обо мне. И даже если он мне что-то запрещает делать - это потому, что его беспокоит моя безопасность.
@cody_barry3_4_c=It may be annoying, but I like it. It rarely happened before. At the orphanage other boys picked on me. And I didn't like any of the staff.
@cody_barry3_5_c=He would be a cool...
@cody_barry3_6_a=A cool what?
@cody_barry3_7_c=...
@cody_barry3_8_c=A teacher or a guardian, you know.

@npc3_ginger_caption=About Cate...
@npc3_ginger_dead_caption=Cate
@npc2_ginger_dead_caption=Cate

@npc3_ginger1_1_a=What do you think about Cate?
@npc3_ginger1_2_c=She's nice.
@npc3_ginger1_3_a=Just that? Simply nice?
@npc3_ginger1_4_c=Nice. And pretty.
@npc3_ginger1_5_a=Alright, let's stop it there.

@npc3_ginger2_1_a=Any new thoughts on Cate?
@npc3_ginger2_2_c=She is nice, but a bit scary.
@npc3_ginger2_3_a=How so?
@npc3_ginger2_4_c=Like, she is pretty but also kinda mean.
@npc3_ginger2_5_c=But not really.
@npc3_ginger2_6_a=Not really?
@npc3_ginger2_7_c=Yeah. I think she is a good person. She just tries to hide it.
@npc3_ginger2_8_c=Why would anyone try to hide that they are a nice person?
@npc3_ginger2_9_c=I don't get adults...

@npc3_ginger3_1_a=You still think Cate is mean?
@npc3_ginger3_2_c=Yup!
@npc3_ginger3_3_c=She wouldn't be Cate if she wasn't a little bit mean.
@npc3_ginger3_4_c=Maybe it's her way to show she likes someone.
@npc3_ginger3_5_c=You know ... like she tries to be a badass, which is pretty cool, but at the same time she has to show her friends that they are on the same side.

@npc3_ginger_dead_1_a=You okay, kid?
@npc3_ginger_dead_2_c=No...
@npc3_ginger_dead_3_c=Nothing is okay. She can't be dead.
@npc3_ginger_dead_4_a=I'm sorry.
@npc3_ginger_dead_5_c=I'm scared.
@npc3_ginger_dead_6_a=Don't be. I'll be close.
@npc3_ginger_dead_7_a=We'll stick together till the end.

@cody_give_coat_caption=Take this
@cody_give_coat_1_a=Take this coat.
@cody_give_coat_2_b=It's too big for me!
@cody_give_coat_3_a=I know, but you'll have to wear it later when it gets really cold.
@cody_give_coat_4_b=Uh ... okay.
@cody_give_coat_5_c=Hah. You're good with kids, David.
@cody_give_coat_6_a=I don't know, am I?
@cody_give_coat_7_b=Hey, I'm not a kid!

@cody_bad_coat_caption=Take this
@cody_bad_coat_1_a=Hey, take this coat.
@cody_bad_coat_2_b=Why? It's soooo hot! I'm gonna melt if I wear this thing!
@cody_bad_coat_3_a=Yeah. You're probably right. Forget it.

@cody_already_coat_caption=Take this
@cody_already_coat_1_a=Hey, take this coat.
@cody_already_coat_2_b=But ... you already gave me one.
@cody_already_coat_3_a=Oh, right. I did. Sorry.

@cody_bad2_coat_caption=Take this
@cody_bad2_coat_1_a=Here, take this coat.
@cody_bad2_coat_2_b=No, thank you.
@cody_bad2_coat_3_b=I'm okay.

@cody_give_water_caption=Take this
@cody_give_water_1_a=Take this water.
@cody_give_water_2_b=Wow - thanks! I'm really thirsty.
@cody_give_water_3_a=You'd better save it for later, when the weather gets really, really hot.
@cody_give_water_4_b=Uh ... okay.

@cody_bad_water_caption=Take this
@cody_bad_water_1_a=Hey, take this water.
@cody_bad_water_2_b=But it's snowing everywhere. If I'm thirsty, I just have to open my mouth wide and catch some snow!
@cody_bad_water_3_b=Aaaaaaaaaaah
@cody_bad_water_4_a=Yeah, you're probably right. Forget it.

@cody_already_water_caption=Take this
@cody_already_water_1_a=Hey, take this water.
@cody_already_water_2_b=But ... you already gave me a bottle.
@cody_already_water_3_a=Oh, right. I did. Sorry.

@cody_bad2_water_caption=Take this
@cody_bad2_water_1_a=Here, take this water.
@cody_bad2_water_2_b=No, thank you.
@cody_bad2_water_3_b=I'm okay.

@npc3_go_vent_caption=Could you crawl through that vent?

@npc3_go_vent_1_a=Hey, Cody. Do you think you could crawl through that vent over there?
@npc3_go_vent_2_b=Huh? Why?
@npc3_go_vent_3_a=Because this door is locked. Maybe there's a way to open it from inside.
@npc3_go_vent_4_b=Okay, just wait here. I'll open it.

@cody_vent_open_caption=Vent
@cody_vent_open_1_b=Tada!
@cody_vent_open_2_b=There is nothing here, though. Just some office stuff.
@cody_vent_open_3_a=Thanks, Cody.

@cody_barry_dead_caption=Barry
@cody_barry_dead_1_a=How are you holding up, kid?
@cody_barry_dead_2_b=I miss Barry...
@cody_barry_dead_3_b=He was so kind and good...
@cody_barry_dead_4_b=...
@cody_barry_dead_day2=But he died because of that heat...
@cody_barry_dead_sidereal=But then he fell into that hole...
@cody_barry_dead_5_b=*sniff*
@cody_barry_dead_6_a=Shh ... don't cry... 
@cody_barry_dead_7_b=I'm not ... *sniff* ... crying...

@cody_exit_1_a=Later.

@npc3_gave_gun_1_a=There. Those are the basics.
@npc3_gave_gun_2_b=Did I do well?
@npc3_gave_gun_3_a=Yeah. You just have to be really careful with this.
@npc3_gave_gun_4_b=Sure.
@npc3_gave_gun_5_a=*sigh*
@npc3_gave_gun_6_b=What? Did I do something wrong?
@npc3_gave_gun_7_a=No, it's just ... I really don't want you to get involved in a fight.
@npc3_gave_gun_8_a=I'm not making you a soldier.
@npc3_gave_gun_9_c=Feels like you kinda are, David.

@npc3_give_gun_1_c=Tell me if I'm wrong, but are you about to give Cody a revolver?
@npc3_give_gun_2_a=That was the plan.
@npc3_give_gun_3_b=Whaaat?
@npc3_give_gun_4_c=I'm not sure if this is responsible behavior.
@npc3_give_gun_5_b=I want a gun!
@npc3_give_gun_6_a=He has to be able to defend himself, Cate.
@npc3_give_gun_7_c=Yeah...
@npc3_give_gun_8_c=But can he actually even use it?
@npc3_give_gun_9_b=I know where the trigger is. I've seen enough action movies!
@npc3_give_gun_10_a=That's not really enough to be able to defend yourself, Cody.
@npc3_give_gun_11_a=But I'll teach you.
@npc3_give_gun_12_a=Do you still have that can I gave you at the restaurant?
@npc3_give_gun_13_b=Umm ... yes. But it's empty. I ate it.
@npc3_give_gun_14_a=That's okay. All we need is an empty can. We will use it for target practice.
@npc3_give_gun_15_a=Put it over there and come back here.

@rv_body2_1_a=He doesn't have anything interesting. Not much I can do for that poor guy.
@rv_body2_2_b=Are you sure you don't want to bury him?
@rv_body2_3_b=Because we have sooo much time on our hands.
@rv_body2_4_a=Cate ... we buried Barry's wife to help him.
@rv_body2_5_b=So why are they not worth getting their own funeral?
@rv_body2_6_a=Don't be snarky, okay? Of course they're worth it. We just don't have the time.
@rv_body2_7_b=Hear that? Sorry guys, it's past our grave-digging time for today.
@rv_body2_8_a=Whatever, Catherine.

@rv_rope_1_a=Maybe if I tie this rope to the hook...
@rv_rope_2_b=I don't think the rope is long enough to reach to the cave from here.
@rv_rope_3_b=Because that's what you've been trying to do, right?
@rv_rope_4_a=There's got to be another way.

@sidereal_entry_closed_1_a=Shouldn't there be a door here?
@sidereal_entry_closed_2_b=There is. It's probably a few feet under all that sand.
@sidereal_entry_closed_3_a=We could bring a shovel and...
@sidereal_entry_closed_4_b=Are you serious? Digging a desert's worth of sand would take us hours.
@sidereal_entry_closed_5_b=No time for that.
@sidereal_entry_closed_6_b=Let's look for another way in.

@sidereal_streetlamp_1_a=Give it a few more months and this lamp will completely disappear under the sand.
@sidereal_streetlamp_2_b=This world doesn't have a few months.

@sidereal_watchout_1_b=WATCH OUT!!!

@fall_aah=Aaaaaaaaahhhh!!

@day3_funeral_cody_1_a=I promised he would be safe with us.
@day3_funeral_cody_2_b=You did all you could.
@day3_funeral_cody_3_a=I don't know, did I?
@day3_funeral_cody_4_a=If we were better prepared, Cody could have lived.
@day3_funeral_cody_5_b=You can't change the past.
@day3_funeral_cody_6_a=The world was just unfair to that poor boy...
@day3_funeral_cody_7_b=Let's just ... remember him.
@day3_funeral_cody_8_b=And focus on our survival.
@day3_funeral_cody_barry=Farewell, Cody. I hope you're in a better place now.

@day3_funeral_barry_1_a=I'm sorry, Barry ... I've failed you ... 
@day3_funeral_barry_2_b=You did all you could.
@day3_funeral_barry_3_a=You think so?
@day3_funeral_barry_4_a=Maybe there was something I've missed. Something that could have saved him.
@day3_funeral_barry_5_b=You can't change the past.
@day3_funeral_barry_6_a=At least he is with his wife again.
@day3_funeral_barry_7_b=If you believe in that sort of thing.
@day3_funeral_barry_8_b=Come on, David. We have work to do.
@day3_funeral_barry_cody=Goodbye, Barry. I will miss you.

@day3_intro0_1_b=So ... you had another bad dream?
@day3_intro0_2_a=Yeah, not a very pleasant one...
@day3_intro0_3_a=There were these ... people. Thugs.
@day3_intro0_4_a=Bandits. They raided our hideout.
@day3_intro0_5_a=They had guns. They wanted to kill us.
@day3_intro0_6_b=So we'll have to defend ourselves.

@day3_intro1_1_b=So ... you had another bad dream?
@day3_intro1_2_a=Yeah, not a very pleasant one...
@day3_intro1_3_a=There was a storm. A thunderstorm.
@day3_intro1_4_a=The rain was burning, like it was acid.
@day3_intro1_5_a=And lightning was striking all around.
@day3_intro1_6_b=I see. We'll have to prepare for it then.

@day3_intro_1_b=David, there's something I have to tell you.
@day3_intro_2_b=I also had a dream.
@day3_intro_3_a=You saw what I saw?
@day3_intro_4_b=No ... I saw a city.
@day3_intro_5_b=I know where to find the spaceship, David.
@day3_intro_6_b=Or at least, I know how to look for it.
@day3_intro_7_a=What? Where?
@day3_intro_8_b=Sidereal. The corporation that built those ships had a number of outposts and offices across the ... well, everywhere, actually.
@day3_intro_9_b=In my dream I saw one of them in the deserted city in the southwest.
@day3_intro_10_b=It was just an office, but if we get there, we might find the location of the spaceship outpost.
@day3_intro_11_a=So ... you don't know for certain.
@day3_intro_12_b=David, have I doubted your dreams for one second?
@day3_intro_13_b=I need you to trust me on this one.
@day3_intro_14_b=We've gotta get there as soon as possible.
@day3_intro_15_b=Before we spend any time preparing for what's coming tonight.

@day3_intro_cutscene_1_a=The city didn't survive even the first weeks after the apocalypse.
@day3_intro_cutscene_2_a=Hit by earthquakes, it was quickly abandoned, only to be swallowed by sands after the climate changed.
@day3_intro_cutscene_3_a=I never liked the idea of going there.
@day3_intro_cutscene_4_a=It was like a massive tombstone emerging from the wasteland, luring travelers so it could become a grave for more victims.
@day3_intro_cutscene_5_a=Yet this was the place we had to go to.

@d2_dream_cody_1_a=What is it Cody? You seem excited.
@d2_dream_cody_2_c=I have something important to tell you! It's like ... super-duper important!
@d2_dream_cody_3_c=We have to prepare for tonight! Even more than yesterday!
@d2_dream_cody_4_a=Yes, Cody. I know...
@d2_dream_cody_5_c=But you don't know why yet!
@d2_dream_cody_6_a=I don't? I thought...
@d2_dream_cody_7_c=Shush! I had a dream. There were like dozens of zombies coming towards the house.
@d2_dream_cody_8_c=They wanted my brain! We have to protect it! I don't want to be eaten...
@d2_dream_cody_9_c=They had those ugly faces, and they were slowly walking with their arms in front of them.
@d2_dream_cody_10_c=They were speaking to me. All like, "Braaaaaains!"
@d2_dream_cody_11_a=Cody ... Zombies are not real. You had a bad dream, that's all.
@d2_dream_cody_12_c=What? No! Why? Your dreams are better than mine?!
@d2_dream_cody_13_a=I'm not saying they are better...
@d2_dream_cody_14_c=So you believe me that there are zombies coming after me!
@d2_dream_cody_15_a=No one is chasing you, Cody...
@d2_dream_cody_16_c=I hope zombies will think you are tasty...

@barry_bag_of_food1_1_c=You'd better give that to Cody. He's so skinny.
@barry_bag_of_food1_2_b=I'm not!
@barry_bag_of_food1_3_b=Wait, what's this?
@barry_bag_of_food1_4_b=Can I have it...?
@barry_bag_of_food1_5_c=Ha ha, sure, little buddy. David, give him some!

@barry_bag_of_food2_1_c=I'm not hungry, thanks.
@barry_bag_of_food2_2_a=You sure?
@barry_bag_of_food2_3_c=Yeah. Kinda lost my appetite.

@cody_bag_of_food_1_a=Are you hungry, Cody?
@cody_bag_of_food_2_c=YES!
@cody_bag_of_food_3_c=Thank you!

@dead_bird_cody_1_c=Yuck!
@dead_bird_cody_2_c=Can I poke it?

@dead_bird_barry_1_c=I'm not sure you should walk around with it in your backpack.

@dead_bird_cate_1_b=Wha....
@dead_bird_cate_2_b=Are you a cat or something?
@dead_bird_cate_3_b=Or are you just really bad with women.

@whiskey_cate_1_b=Maybe some other time. I need to keep my mind focused.
@whiskey_cate_2_b=But to tell the truth, I wouldn't mind a glass of wine.

@whiskey_barry_1_c=No, thank you. I stopped drinking some time ago. Maggie said it would be better for my health.

@whiskey_cody_1_c=Wow. Really? Can I?
@whiskey_cody_2_b=David, you shouldn't...
@whiskey_cody_3_c=Aww...

@fan_cate_1_a=Is this your biggest fan?
@fan_cate_2_b=...
@fan_cate_3_b=Why are you the way you are, David?

@oil_cate_1_b=Are you giving this to me because I'm a woman...?
@oil_cate_2_a=What?! No!
@oil_cate_3_b=Good.

@lighter_barry_1_c=Oh, this is ... almost identical to a lighter I got from Maggie on our 5th anniversary.
@lighter_barry_2_c=She had our wedding date engraved on it, though.
@lighter_barry_3_c=A few years later I quit smoking for her.
@lighter_barry_4_c=I wonder where that lighter went....

@rope_cate_1_b=Do you want me to tie you up or something?
@rope_cate_2_b=I'm not really into that kind of thing.
@rope_cate_3_b=On the other hand, I could take a break from you.

@rope_barry_1_c=I'm not THAT desperate, thanks.
@rope_barry_2_c=Also, this was really distasteful.

@rope_cody_1_c=Yay! Tug of war!

@sidereal_disk_comp_1_a=Hmm...
@sidereal_disk_comp_2_b=[READING DISK...]
@sidereal_disk_comp_3_b=[Error: This disk has been encrypted and will only work on a designated workstation]
@sidereal_disk_comp_4_a=Well, it was worth a try...
@sidereal_disk_comp_5_a=I've taken the disk back.

@sidereal_afterfall_1_a=No!!!
@sidereal_afterfall_2_a=Cody!!!
@sidereal_afterfallb_2_a=Barry!!!
@sidereal_afterfall_3_a=CODY!!! ^ ... ^Can you hear me?!
@sidereal_afterfallb_3_a=BARRY!!! ^ ... ^Can you hear me?!
@sidereal_afterfall_4_b=David...
@sidereal_afterfall_5_b=We are on a roof and this hole seems to go all the way down. It's at least a 4-story drop, if not more.
@sidereal_afterfall_6_b=He couldn't survive that.
@sidereal_afterfall_7_a=Maybe he did.
@sidereal_afterfall_8_a=Maybe he landed on sand.
@sidereal_afterfall_9_a=How can you know?
@sidereal_afterfall_10_a=CODY!!!
@sidereal_afterfallb_10_a=BARRY!!!
@sidereal_afterfall_11_b=David.
@sidereal_afterfall_12_b=...

@sidereal_afterfall_cody_1_a=It's alright.
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_2_a=You're safe. Calm down.
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_3_b=W-where is Barry...?
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_4_a=I ... I'm sorry, I couldn't grab both of you.
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_5_b=Noo!!
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_6_b=Why didn't you save Barry?

@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans1_caption=He didn't want to live.
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans1_1_a=I don't think ... I don't think he really wanted to live anyway.
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans1_1_a=After he lost his wife, his life was empty.
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans1_3_b=N-No, that is stupid. Everything is so stupid...
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans1_4_b=*sobs*

@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans2_caption=He wanted me to save you
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans2_1_a=I think he'd want me to save you, Cody.
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans2_2_b=S-so it is my fault...?
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans2_3_a=No! No, no, no.
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans2_4_a=He just ... he cared about you more than he cared about himself.
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans2_5_b=...
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans2_6_b=*sobs*
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans2_7_a=Shh ... calm down. We have to move.

@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans3_caption=Don't ask
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans3_1_a=Please don't make it any more difficult than it already is.
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans3_2_b=...
@sidereal_afterfall_cody_ans2_3_b=*sobs*

@sidereal_afterfall_barry_1_a=You okay?
@sidereal_afterfall_barry_2_b=Why ... why didn't you save Cody?!
@sidereal_afterfall_barry_3_a=I wanted to save you both. I thought maybe I could make it.
@sidereal_afterfall_barry_4_b=No ... you knew.
@sidereal_afterfall_barry_5_a=Yes, Barry, I knew. I had to choose.
@sidereal_afterfall_barry_6_b=So why me?

@sidereal_afterfall_barry_ans1_caption=You are more valuable
@sidereal_afterfall_barry_ans1_1_a=You are a more valuable asset to the team.
@sidereal_afterfall_barry_ans1_2_a=You are stronger.
@sidereal_afterfall_barry_ans1_3_b=...
@sidereal_afterfall_barry_ans1_4_b=You heartless bastard.

@sidereal_afterfall_barry_ans2_caption=He won't have to suffer anymore
@sidereal_afterfall_barry_ans2_1_a=This world isn't any good for kids.
@sidereal_afterfall_barry_ans2_2_a=It has no future to look forward to.
@sidereal_afterfall_barry_ans2_3_a=Cody had suffered enough.
@sidereal_afterfall_barry_ans2_4_b=It is so unfair...

@sidereal_afterfall_barry_ans3_caption=Don't ask
@sidereal_afterfall_barry_ans3_1_a=Please don't make it any more difficult than it already is.
@sidereal_afterfall_barry_ans3_2_b=...

@sidereal_afterfall_cate_1_b=David, I know this is terrible but we can't let him die for nothing.
@sidereal_afterfall_cate_2_b=Get to the opening. I'll try to find another way in.
@sidereal_afterfall_cate_3_b=Find the location of that base.
@sidereal_afterfall_cate_4_b=Look for documents or a map of some sort.
@sidereal_afterfall_cate_5_b=We'll just meet up later. Good luck.

@sidereal_nofall_barry_1_a=You okay?
@sidereal_nofall_barry_2_b=Whoa, that was close, wasn't it?
@sidereal_nofall_barry_3_b=Thanks. You saved me.
@sidereal_nofall_barry_4_a=No problem.
@sidereal_nofall_barry_5_b=So ... what now?

@sidereal_nofall_cody_1_a=You okay?
@sidereal_nofall_cody_2_b=WOW, did you see that?!
@sidereal_nofall_cody_3_b=This hole is, like, bottomless.
@sidereal_nofall_cody_4_b=I was so scared. But you saved me!
@sidereal_nofall_cody_5_a=You were actually very brave. And you'd do the same for me.
@sidereal_nofall_cody_6_b=So ... what now?

@sidereal_nofall_cate_1_a=We're lucky nobody fell there. It looks really deep.
@sidereal_nofall_cate_2_b=Yeah. Lucky us...
@sidereal_nofall_cate_3_b=It seems you have to go on without me for now.
@sidereal_nofall_cate_4_b=Find the location of that base.
@sidereal_nofall_cate_5_b=Look for documents or a map of some sort.
@sidereal_nofall_cate_6_b=We'll just meet up later. Good luck.

@sidereal_savedfalltalk_cate_1_a=You okay?
@sidereal_savedfalltalk_cate_2_b=Yeah. I'm fine.
@sidereal_savedfalltalk_cate_3_b=I'm not going with you though, it seems.

@sidereal_nofall2_cate_1_a=You okay?
@sidereal_nofall2_cate_2_b=Yeah. I'm fine.
@sidereal_nofall2_cate_3_b=It seems you have to go on without me for now.
@sidereal_nofall2_cate_4_b=Find the location of that base.
@sidereal_nofall2_cate_5_b=Look for documents or a map of some sort.
@sidereal_nofall2_cate_6_b=We'll just meet up later. Good luck.

@sidereal_cody_death1_1_b=*cough*^*cough*
@sidereal_cody_death1_2_a=Cody...?
@sidereal_cody_death1_3_b=D-David?
@sidereal_cody_death2_1_a=Cody.
@sidereal_cody_death2_2_b=Where ... where is Cate?
@sidereal_cody_death2_3_a=S-she is fine.
@sidereal_cody_death2_4_b=I ... I can't move.
@sidereal_cody_death2_5_a=Cody, stay calm. You'll be fine.
@sidereal_cody_death2_6_b=It's cold.
@sidereal_cody_death2_7_a=Everything is going to be fine.
@sidereal_cody_death2_8_b=I'm so scared.
@sidereal_cody_death2_9_b=Don't go away.
@sidereal_cody_death2_10_a=Just stay calm. I'm here. I'm right here.
@sidereal_cody_death2_11_b=Dad ... where have you been?
@sidereal_cody_death2_12_b=Don't go away again.
@sidereal_cody_death2_13_a=...
@sidereal_cody_death2_14_b=I've lost my plushie tiger, dad.
@sidereal_cody_death2_15_b=I don't know where it is.
@sidereal_cody_death2_16_a=...
@sidereal_cody_death2_17_c=We'll find it, Cody. We'll get it for you.
@sidereal_cody_death2_18_a=Hold my hand, Cody. I'm here.
@sidereal_cody_death2_19_a=Cody...?
@sidereal_cody_death2_20_a=Cody...?

@sidereal_barry_death1_1_b=*cough*^*cough*
@sidereal_barry_death1_2_b=Aaaahh...
@sidereal_barry_death1_3_c=Barry! You're alive!
@sidereal_barry_death2_1_b=Looks like ... hah ... looks like my expectations about this place have suddenly dropped.
@sidereal_barry_death2_2_a=Hah ... you're terrible.
@sidereal_barry_death2_3_b=I also feel terrible.
@sidereal_barry_death2_4_a=W-what should I do?
@sidereal_barry_death2_5_b=You got the location of the base?
@sidereal_barry_death2_6_a=Yes.
@sidereal_barry_death2_7_b=Good. Get out of here then.
@sidereal_barry_death2_8_a=Can't leave you like that.
@sidereal_barry_death2_9_b=I'm good as done, David.
@sidereal_barry_death2_10_b=Take the kid and go.
@sidereal_barry_death2_11_a=I'm sorry.
@sidereal_barry_death2_12_a=I'm so sorry. I let you fall.
@sidereal_barry_death2_13_b=It's alright.
@sidereal_barry_death2_14_b=You've made the right choice.
@sidereal_barry_death2_15_b=Maggie knew you would make the right choice.
@sidereal_barry_death2_16_a=Huh...?
@sidereal_barry_death2_17_b=My wife ... she ... knew. In her note ... she wrote...
@sidereal_barry_death2_18_b=...that she knows you'll make the right choice when the time comes.
@sidereal_barry_death2_19_b=The note was for me, but that section, that line...
@sidereal_barry_death2_20_b=That was for you.
@sidereal_barry_death2_21_b=I know it. I see it.
@sidereal_barry_death2_22_c=Barry, get up! Please!
@sidereal_barry_death2_23_b=In a sec. Okay, kid? Uncle Barry's gotta rest his bones a bit.
@sidereal_barry_death2_24_b=Go, David. Take good care of him and Cate.
@sidereal_barry_death2_25_b=I ... don't know ... where you're going ... but ... 
@sidereal_barry_death2_26_b=I'll meet you.
@sidereal_barry_death2_27_b=In another life.
@sidereal_barry_death2_28_a=Goodbye, Barry.

@ginger_sidereal_reunion_barry_1_a=Cate.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_barry_2_b=David. You've got the location?
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_barry_3_a=You really don't care about Barry, do you?
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_barry_4_a=Don't you want to ask about him first?
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_barry_5_b=I just assumed he is dead.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_barry_6_a=He DIED for this information, Cate. He DIED, for god's sake.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_barry_7_b=Like I said, that's what I assumed.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_barry_8_a=Oh, okay. Assume I've got your stupid map then.

@ginger_sidereal_reunion_cody_1_a=Cate.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_cody_2_b=David. You've got the location?
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_cody_3_a=You really don't care about Cody, do you?
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_cody_4_a=Don't you want to ask about him first?
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_cody_5_b=I just assumed he is dead.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_cody_6_a=He DIED for this information, Cate. He DIED, for god's sake.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_cody_7_b=Like I said, that's what I assumed.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_cody_8_a=Oh, okay. Assume I've got your stupid map then.

@ginger_sidereal_reunion_1_a=Cate.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_2_b=David. You've got the location?
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_3_a=Yeah. I've found a map.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_4_a=Thanks for your concern.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_5_b=Why? You're fine.

@ginger_sidereal_reunion_map_1_b=Show me it.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_map_2_a=Take a look. The launchpad is here in the mountains.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_map_3_a=We can go right away.

@cody_sidereal_reunion_1_b=David!
@cody_sidereal_reunion_alt=You're back!
@cody_sidereal_reunion_2_b=Barry! You're back!
@cody_sidereal_reunion_3_a=I told you I would be.
@cody_sidereal_reunion_4_b=Was it scary there?
@cody_sidereal_reunion_5_a=Maybe a little bit.
@cody_sidereal_reunion_6_b=Don't leave me again, okay?
@cody_sidereal_reunion_7_a=I won't, Cody.
@cody_sidereal_reunion_8_b=Promise? Never-ever?
@cody_sidereal_reunion_9_a=Never-ever.
@cody_sidereal_reunion_10_a=There might still be something worth checking out in that building.
@cody_sidereal_reunion_11_a=Hey, wanna go explore that office now?
@cody_sidereal_reunion_12_b=Uh, it's a bit scary.
@cody_sidereal_reunion_13_a=It's safe now. I promise.

@barry_sidereal_reunion_1_b=It's good to see you two back.
@barry_sidereal_reunion_alt=It's good to see you back and in one piece.
@barry_sidereal_reunion_2_b=Cate told me what happened.
@barry_sidereal_reunion_3_b=If you hadn't warned me to stay...
@barry_sidereal_reunion_4_b=How did you know...?
@barry_sidereal_reunion_5_b=Dreams?
@barry_sidereal_reunion_6_a=Yes. Dreams.
@barry_sidereal_reunion_7_a=There might still be something worth checking out in that building.
@barry_sidereal_reunion_8_a=I think it's safe to go together now, Barry.
@barry_sidereal_reunion_9_b=If you say it's important...
@barry_sidereal_reunion_10_a=But first...

@ginger_sidereal_reunion_bandits_1_b=What about your dream? The bandits, raiders.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_bandits_2_a=What about them? If we get to the launchpad fast, they won't be our problem.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_bandits_3_b=I ... don't know, David. You HAD that dream. It might mean we won't escape them just like that.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_bandits_4_b=If the ship is still there it might require a lot of work before it takes off.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_bandits_5_b=If those thugs follow us there ... No, they can't find out about the ship.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_bandits_6_b=We have to deal with them first. We have to stay one more night.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_bandits_7_a=You realize you're putting our lives at risk? They have guns.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_bandits_8_b=We CAN'T lead them to that ship.

@ginger_sidereal_reunion_storm_1_b=What about your dream? The storm, acid rain, thunder.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_storm_2_a=What about them? If we get to the launchpad fast, they won't be our problem.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_storm_3_b=I ... don't know, David. You HAD that dream. It might mean we won't escape them just like that.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_storm_4_b=The wind blows from the east. The storm comes from that direction.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_storm_5_b=If we go there today, it might catch us in the open before we find the ship and we can't launch during a storm for sure.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_storm_6_b=We have to wait for this storm to pass in our base. We have to stay one more night.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_storm_7_a=How about we stay here, then?
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_storm_8_b=The storm will get to us here, too. You've seen weather anomalies before, David.
@ginger_sidereal_reunion_storm_9_b=I'd rather be in our reinforced base than here in this death trap, flooded with sand AND acid rain water.

@ginger_sidereal_reveal_caption=Catherine Mayweather
@ginger_sidereal_reveal_1_a=Mayweather. Catherine Mayweather.
@ginger_sidereal_reveal_2_b=Huh?
@ginger_sidereal_reveal_3_a=Is that your name?
@ginger_sidereal_reveal_4_b=Why do you ask?
@ginger_sidereal_reveal_5_a=I've seen it in one of the documents. You worked for Sidereal, didn't you?
@ginger_sidereal_reveal_6_b=...
@ginger_sidereal_reveal_7_b=Briefly.
@ginger_sidereal_reveal_8_b=I didn't even know where this office was before the dream I just had.
@ginger_sidereal_reveal_9_b=And I definitely wasn't important enough to earn my place on the lifeboat, it appears.

@ginger_sidereal_why_caption=Why hide it?
@ginger_sidereal_why_1_a=Why hide it? Why conceal that information?
@ginger_sidereal_why_2_b=Isn't it obvious, David?
@ginger_sidereal_why_3_b=Sidereal caused it. All of it.
@ginger_sidereal_why_4_a=The Moon...?
@ginger_sidereal_why_5_b=Yes. And ... more than that.
@ginger_sidereal_why_6_b=I wasn't directly involved. But you can imagine I don't want to be shot in the face by a stranger for mentioning that my employer has accidentally destroyed the world.

@ginger_sidereal_else_caption=What else are you hiding?
@ginger_sidereal_else_1_a=What else are you hiding?
@ginger_sidereal_else_2_b=Nothing. Jeez, David.
@ginger_sidereal_else_3_a=I'm sorry, but I think you know more than you say. That turned out to be truth in the past ... and I think it's still the case.
@ginger_sidereal_else_4_b=Alright. You don't have to trust me if you don't want to.
@ginger_sidereal_else_5_b=Just help me get to that ship.

@ginger_sidereal_ship_caption=The ship is gone.
@ginger_sidereal_ship_1_a=So, from the documents I've found it seems people from this office were evacuated to the launchpad.
@ginger_sidereal_ship_2_a=Wouldn't that mean the ship is long gone?
@ginger_sidereal_ship_3_b=It's not gone.
@ginger_sidereal_ship_4_a=How do you know?
@ginger_sidereal_ship_5_b=Dreams, David. I also keep having them.

@ginger_sidereal_dreams_caption=Where do those dreams come from?
@ginger_sidereal_dreams_1_a=Where do you think those dreams come from?
@ginger_sidereal_dreams_2_a=How is it even possible?
@ginger_sidereal_dreams_3_b=I believe those are visions...
@ginger_sidereal_dreams_4_b=...sent by someone.
@ginger_sidereal_dreams_5_a=I'd think you're crazy if I didn't have the same thoughts myself...
@ginger_sidereal_dreams_6_b=Maybe we're both crazy then.
@ginger_sidereal_dreams_7_a=Well, that's always possible.

@ginger_pills_here_1_b=You seem to be very happy with yourself.
@ginger_pills_here_2_b=What did you do?
@ginger_pills_here_3_a=I think those pills will increase lung efficiency.
@ginger_pills_here_4_b=You think?
@ginger_pills_here_5_b=Are you really going to digest an unknown, probably untested, chemical?
@ginger_pills_here_6_a=Not just me. You should do it, too.
@ginger_pills_here_7_b=Eh, alright. Don't forget to share those pills then.

@cs_park_start=I could sneak through there. Maybe they won't notice me...
@cs_park_single=Cate, you better stay here.
@cs_park_multi=Guys, you better stay here.
@cs_park_nogo_1_b=Are you sure this is a good idea?
@cs_park_nogo_2_a=No, but it might work. Maybe there is a backdoor somewhere there.
@cs_park_nogo_3_b=Alright. Even if you sneak past guards...
@cs_park_nogo_4_b=Even if you find a way in...
@cs_park_nogo_5_b=What exactly do you intend to do?
@cs_park_nogo_6_b=You're not exactly a "special task forces" type.
@cs_park_nogo_7_a=I'm just gonna look around.
@cs_park_nogo_8_a=Maybe I'll find something useful.
@cs_park_nogo_9_b=Don't get yourself shot.
@cs_park_nogo_plus_cody_1_a=Please be careful, okay?
@cs_park_nogo_plus_cody_2_b=I promise I'll be back soon.
@cs_park_nogo_plus_barry_1_a=See? She does care about you after all.
@cs_park_nogo_plus_barry_2_b=Shut up.
@cs_park_gate_1_a=The entrance is guarded...
@cs_park_gate_2_b=Who would have thought?
@cs_park_gate_3_a=Well, going there would be suicide.

@restaurant_dead_cody_known_1_a=It's that boy who was looking for food ... He's dead.
@restaurant_dead_cody_known_2_b=Damn it, David. We should have helped him.
@restaurant_dead_cody_known_3_a=...
@restaurant_dead_cody_known_4_a=Don't think about it now.
@restaurant_dead_cody_known_5_a=There was nothing we could do.
@restaurant_dead_cody_known_6_b=Keep telling yourself that.

@restaurant_dead_cody_unknown_1_a=He looks like ten, maybe eleven years old.
@restaurant_dead_cody_unknown_2_a=He didn't make it through the night.
@restaurant_dead_cody_unknown_3_b=Damn it, David. We should have helped him.
@restaurant_dead_cody_unknown_4_a=Don't think about it now.
@restaurant_dead_cody_unknown_5_a=There was nothing we could do.
@restaurant_dead_cody_unknown_6_b=Keep telling yourself that.

@houseb_dead_barry_known_1_a=It's that mourning man. He's dead...
@houseb_dead_barry_known_2_b=He got what he wanted.
@houseb_dead_barry_known_3_a=...
@houseb_dead_barry_known_4_a=How can you even say something like that?
@houseb_dead_barry_known_5_b=I'm right though. He was waiting here for death.
@houseb_dead_barry_known_6_a=Maybe we could have prevented this...

@houseb_dead_barry_unknown_1_a=He's not moving ... I think he's dead.
@houseb_dead_barry_unknown_2_b=Another corpse in the wasteland.
@houseb_dead_barry_unknown_3_a=Maybe if we'd found him earlier, we could have prevented this.
@houseb_dead_barry_unknown_4_b=Maybe.

@restaurant_blocked_bugs_1_a=Oh no. No, no, no.
@restaurant_blocked_bugs_2_b=Are those the same bugs that have been scattering around your hideout?
@restaurant_blocked_bugs_3_a=Nasty creatures. They almost ate me yesterday.
@restaurant_blocked_bugs_4_b=Well, too bad they are blocking our way now.
@restaurant_blocked_bugs_5_a=Do you think we can do something to get rid of them?
@restaurant_blocked_bugs_6_b=Honestly? This looks almost like a hive. I think we should come back tomorrow.
@restaurant_blocked_bugs_7_b=The temperature will either kill them or force them to move.
@restaurant_blocked_bugs_8_b=So let's just get back here later.

@restaurant_blocked_gas_1_a=Careful now. I know this gas.
@restaurant_blocked_gas_2_b=Let me guess ... It's the gas from last night that almost killed you.
@restaurant_blocked_gas_3_a=Yes. The cloud is gone but some of it must be stuck here from the poor ventilation.
@restaurant_blocked_gas_4_b=Too bad it's blocking our way now.
@restaurant_blocked_gas_5_a=Do you think we can do something to get rid of it?
@restaurant_blocked_gas_6_b=Honestly? I don't know if there is anything we can do that won't take the entire day.
@restaurant_blocked_gas_7_b=I bet this just disperses on its own by tomorrow.
@restaurant_blocked_gas_8_b=Let's just come back later.

@restaurant_blocked_spiders_1_a=Oh, not this again.
@restaurant_blocked_spiders_2_b=I hope there aren't any spiders left here.
@restaurant_blocked_spiders_3_b=I've seen their corpses around the hideout, and I wouldn't want to meet them face-to-face, to be honest.
@restaurant_blocked_spiders_4_a=Maybe it's just leftover webs.
@restaurant_blocked_spiders_5_b=Leftover or not, they are blocking our way now.
@restaurant_blocked_spiders_6_a=Do you think we can do something to get rid of them?
@restaurant_blocked_spiders_7_b=They look kinda strong enough to trap an adult man in place. I think we should come back tomorrow.
@restaurant_blocked_spiders_8_a=Maybe we can dissolve it somehow...?
@restaurant_blocked_spiders_9_b=My guess is this spaghetti of webs will dissolve on its own by tomorrow. Let's just keep this place in mind and come back later.

@gasstation_thugs_1_a=...and that's why I'm not sure if it's a good idea.
@gasstation_thugs_2_b=You're a coward and a fart-knocker, Sarge.
@gasstation_thugs_3_b=We need their supplies so we're gonna take 'em. And their crib is totally dope. Amazing defensive spot for us to use.
@gasstation_thugs_4_a=My point exactly. It's gonna be a good defensive spot for us. It IS a good defensive spot for them.
@gasstation_thugs_5_b=Don't crack me up. We've been watching them for some time now.
@gasstation_thugs_6_b=It's just one dude and a chick. Henpecked husband and his triflin' wife.
@gasstation_thugs_6_b_cody=It's just one dude, a chick, and a freakin' brat. One triflin' happy family.
@gasstation_thugs_6_b_barry=It's just two dudes and a chick. One hoochie triangle.
@gasstation_thugs_6_b_cody_barry=It's just two dudes, a chick, and a freakin' brat. One triflin' happy family plus a blazed uncle.
@gasstation_thugs_7_b=And there's freakin' twenty of us, including your army boy-scouts.
@gasstation_thugs_8_a=...yeah, I guess you're right.
@gasstation_thugs_9_b=Damn right I am.
@gasstation_thugs_10_b=I want your men to be ready at dusk.
@gasstation_thugs_11_b=I've welcomed you in the gang but it's time to start paying off, Sarge.
@gasstation_thugs_12_a=...yeah.
@gasstation_thugs_13_b=Alrighty, we're heading back to the construction site to tell the boys the plan.
@gasstation_thugs_14_c=[Cate] Hmmm ... I think I know what construction site he is talking about... 
@gasstation_thugs_15_c=[Cate] I've seen one back on the helicopter. I'll mark it on your map. Maybe we'll pay them a visit later.
@gasstation_thugs_16_b=You comin'?
@gasstation_thugs_17_a=Yeah, I'll just finish getting that fuel and take another look at the gas station shop.
@gasstation_thugs_18_b=Okay. Catch ya later.
@gasstation_thugs_19_a=Yeah, later.
@gasstation_thugs_20_a=Jerk.

@gasstation_sarge_shot_barry_1_c=[Barry] JESUS CHRIST, DAVID!!!
@gasstation_sarge_shot_barry_2_c=[Barry] You've just blown his head off!!!
@gasstation_sarge_shot_barry_3_a=[David] It's him or us, Barry.
@gasstation_sarge_shot_barry_4_c=[Barry] Since when are WE the bad guys here?
@gasstation_sarge_shot_barry_5_c=[Barry] Or have I misjudged you?
@gasstation_sarge_shot_barry_6_b=[Cate] Barry, calm down.
@gasstation_sarge_shot_barry_7_c=[Barry] Calm down? No, I won't calm down.
@gasstation_sarge_shot_barry_8_c=[Barry] We don't act like that. We shouldn't act like that.

@gasstation_sarge_shot_cody_1_c=[Cody] You killed that man!!!
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cody_2_c=[Cody] D-DEAD!
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cody_3_a=[David] I ... I know.
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cody_4_c=[Cody] I'm gonna puke...
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cody_5_b=[Cate] Cody...
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cody_6_c=[Cody] Don't touch me!
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cody_7_a=[David] Wait, Cody.
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cody_8_c=[Cody] STAY AWAY!
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cody_9_a=[David] ...
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cody_10_b=[Cate] He'll be fine. Just give him time.

@gasstation_sarge_shot_cate_1_b=[Cate] ...
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cate_2_a=[David] ...
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cate_3_b=[Cate] I guess this had to be done.
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cate_4_a=[David] Yeah.
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cate_5_a=[David] I guess.
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cate_6_a=[David] What have I become, Cate?
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cate_7_b=[Cate] A far less harmless person than I thought you were, that's for sure.
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cate_8_a=[David] I just wanted to protect us.
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cate_9_b=[Cate] I know, David.
@gasstation_sarge_shot_cate_10_b=[Cate] I know.

@sarge_first_intro_1_b=Give me one good reason not to unload the whole clip into your face.
@sarge_first_intro_2_b=And it'd better be a damn good reason.

@sarge_intro_1_b=You again.

@sarge_first_bye_1_a=So ... that's all for now, I think.
@sarge_first_bye_2_b=For now?
@sarge_first_bye_3_b=Aren't we shooting each other next?
@sarge_first_bye_4_a=I was hoping that could be avoided.
@sarge_first_bye_5_b=Just go away and I'll pretend I haven't seen you, okay?

@sarge_bye_1_a=I should go.
@sarge_bye_2_b=Yes, you should.

@sarge_last_bye_1_b=I guess this is goodbye then.
@sarge_last_bye_2_b=I'll take my squad and leave right before dusk.
@sarge_last_bye_3_b=Make no mistake ... Razor will still try to get you.
@sarge_last_bye_4_b=So you'll have to deal with the rest of his men.
@sarge_last_bye_5_a=How many people will he have?
@sarge_last_bye_6_b=Without us he is down to fifteen.
@sarge_last_bye_7_b=Still, that's a hell of a lot more than you have.
@sarge_last_bye_8_b=Good luck, son.
@sarge_last_bye_9_b=You'll need it.
@sarge_last_bye_10_a=Hey, Sarge...
@sarge_last_bye_11_b=Hmm?
@sarge_last_bye_12_a=Thanks. Good luck out there in the wasteland.

@sarge_wrench_1_a=Need some help?
@sarge_wrench_2_b=No.
@sarge_wrench_3_a=Come on, you'll never open this valve with your bare hands.
@sarge_wrench_4_b=Why do you even help me?
@sarge_wrench_5_a=Because I feel it's the right thing to do.
@sarge_wrench_6_b=...

@sarge_thanks_1_b=Thanks.

@sarge_spaceship_caption=We have a spaceship
@sarge_spaceship_1_a=We have ... we might have a clue to where to find a spaceship.
@sarge_spaceship_2_b=Yeah?
@sarge_spaceship_3_b=What'd you need that for?
@sarge_spaceship_4_a=To ... to escape.
@sarge_spaceship_5_b=To escape? You're out of your mind.
@sarge_spaceship_6_b=Where would you escape?
@sarge_spaceship_7_a=Well, there's a space station.
@sarge_spaceship_8_a=Supposedly.
@sarge_spaceship_9_b=Son, I understand you want to survive at all cost.
@sarge_spaceship_10_b=But this is being delusional.
@sarge_spaceship_11_b=The entire world is dead.
@sarge_spaceship_12_b=This isn't something you just escape from.
@sarge_spaceship_13_b=You can't.
@sarge_spaceship_14_b=There is nowhere to go.
@sarge_spaceship_15_b=There is no magical kingdom, no wonderful utopia waiting for survivors.
@sarge_spaceship_16_b=No space station will save you.
@sarge_spaceship_17_b=Don't let anyone fool you like that.

@sarge_moon_caption=The Moon
@sarge_moon_1_a=The Moon is falling on our heads.
@sarge_moon_2_b=Yeah? Wow, I didn't notice.
@sarge_moon_3_b=Maybe I was too busy trying to look after myself and my squad, because the DAMN MOON EXPLODED AND IS FALLING ON US.
@sarge_moon_4_a=What I meant was ... It is going to crash into Earth. Like, really soon.
@sarge_moon_5_b=Good.
@sarge_moon_6_a=Good?
@sarge_moon_7_b=It's all gonna end. It has to. This whole nightmare.
@sarge_moon_8_b=Let me tell you a story, okay?
@sarge_moon_9_a=Sure...
@sarge_moon_10_b=Our squad was helping with evacuation. We were on a chopper, hovering above a football stadium where people had gathered.
@sarge_moon_11_b=We were picking up the wounded to get them to safety.
@sarge_moon_12_b=Suddenly, BAM!
@sarge_moon_13_b=Another earthquake started and everything went to hell.
@sarge_moon_14_b=Literally. The ground split open, bursting out red flames.
@sarge_moon_15_b=Do you know The Bible?
@sarge_moon_16_a=I'm not an expert.
@sarge_moon_17_b=I wasn't a religious man either. But after seeing all this...
@sarge_moon_18_b=After seeing a whole stadium of people being swallowed by Hell itself in one chomp?
@sarge_moon_19_b=It was then that I realized.
@sarge_moon_20_b=There is no hope.
@sarge_moon_21_b=Nothing is going to end well.
@sarge_moon_22_b=This is judgement day. The final chapter of mankind.

@sarge_bargain_caption=Help
@sarge_bargain_1_a=Got enough fuel?
@sarge_bargain_2_b=Yeah. Thanks for your help, I guess.
@sarge_bargain_3_a=No problem. I guess this is how it should be.
@sarge_bargain_4_a=We don't have to fight, you know.
@sarge_bargain_5_a=There is no need for violence. We can all live in peace.
@sarge_bargain_6_b=Can we? I'm not sure.

@sarge_bargain2_1_a=I still think there's gotta be another way. We don't have to kill each other.
@sarge_bargain2_2_b=I doubt that.

@sarge_cody_caption=We have to protect the kid
@sarge_cody_1_a=There is a kid with me. Cody. He's ten, or something.
@sarge_cody_2_a=He doesn't have to go through this.
@sarge_cody_3_b=Oh but he does. He very much HAS to go through this.
@sarge_cody_4_b=We ALL go through this.
@sarge_cody_5_b=Nobody ever asks us.
@sarge_cody_6_b=I had a son, you know?
@sarge_cody_7_b=Do you think anyone asked me for an opinion when a panicking crowd trampled my poor boy into a mashed sack of broken bones?
@sarge_cody_8_a=I ... I am so sorry...
@sarge_cody_9_b=Yeah, I was sorry, too. I was supposed to protect those people when they tried to evacuate.
@sarge_cody_10_b=And I couldn't even protect my boy.
@sarge_cody_11_b=So, no. The fact you have a kid on your happy team doesn't give you a golden ticket of mercy.
@sarge_cody_12_b=Not from me, at least.

@sarge_just_let_go_caption=Just let us go
@sarge_just_let_go_1_a=Just let us go.
@sarge_just_let_go_2_a=We will leave the house, if you want it so much.
@sarge_just_let_go_3_a=Nobody has to die.
@sarge_just_let_go_4_b=You and I both know this is not going to happen.
@sarge_just_let_go_5_b=You can leave, but Razor will follow you and hunt you down.
@sarge_just_let_go_6_b=Because you're more than just an obstacle for him; you are his prey.

@sarge_honor_caption=You were a soldier
@sarge_honor_1_a=You were a soldier.
@sarge_honor_2_a=A man of honor.
@sarge_honor_3_a=I can't believe someone like you would sign up for a slaughter of innocent people.
@sarge_honor_4_b=The times have changed, son. I have changed.
@sarge_honor_5_b=Nothing is as it used to be. Honor won't feed you. It won't give you a shelter.
@sarge_honor_6_b=The times have changed and so did we, to survive.

@sarge_honor2_caption=Act like a soldier
@sarge_honor2_1_a=This is not how soldiers act.
@sarge_honor2_2_a=This is not who you are.
@sarge_honor2_3_b=I told you.
@sarge_honor2_4_b=I'm no longer a soldier.
@sarge_honor2_5_b=This is who I am now.

@sarge_no_threat_caption=We are no threat to you
@sarge_no_threat_1_a=We pose no threat.
@sarge_no_threat_2_a=You don't have to kill us to survive.
@sarge_no_threat_3_b=As long as you live, you are a threat to Razor. He won't let you just walk out of this.
@sarge_no_threat_4_b=He will follow you and hunt you down.
@sarge_no_threat_5_b=Because you're more than just an obstacle for him; you are his prey.
@sarge_no_threat_6_a=I'm not talking about Razor. I'm talking about you.
@sarge_no_threat_7_b=I ... I do what I can to survive.

@sarge_end_of_days_caption=Time to rethink your life
@sarge_end_of_days_1_a=The times are not just changing.
@sarge_end_of_days_2_a=The times are coming to an end.
@sarge_end_of_days_3_a=These are the final days, can't you see? It will all be over soon.
@sarge_end_of_days_4_b=Maybe. Yet we still bother. We're not all putting bullets to our heads. We still fight to survive.
@sarge_end_of_days_5_a=Yes. We're still trying to survive, against all odds.
@sarge_end_of_days_6_a=Still, we're most likely all going to die.
@sarge_end_of_days_7_a=Our time is running out.
@sarge_end_of_days_8_a=And here we are. Standing in the wasteland, with our hands close to our guns.
@sarge_end_of_days_9_a=Preparing to fight like a bunch of idiots.
@sarge_end_of_days_10_b=What do you suggest we do, then?

@sarge_let_us_go_caption=Let us go
@sarge_let_us_go_1_a=Let us go.
@sarge_let_us_go_2_a=The house is yours.
@sarge_let_us_go_3_a=With all the supplies.
@sarge_let_us_go_4_b=If it was that simple, I would let you go.
@sarge_let_us_go_5_b=Believe me, I would.
@sarge_let_us_go_6_b=But it's NOT that simple.
@sarge_let_us_go_7_b=You can leave, but Razor will follow you and hunt you down.
@sarge_let_us_go_8_b=Because you're more than just an obstacle for him; you are his prey.

@sarge_leave_caption=You should go
@sarge_leave_1_a=Sarge. Take your men and leave.
@sarge_leave_2_b=What?!
@sarge_leave_3_b=Are you kidding?

@sarge_razor_sucks_caption=You don't like working for Razor
@sarge_razor_sucks_1_a=You don't respect Razor.
@sarge_razor_sucks_2_a=You don't like him.
@sarge_razor_sucks_3_a=You only work for him because your squad is counting on you.
@sarge_razor_sucks_4_a=But this is not the right way.
@sarge_razor_sucks_5_a=And deep down, you know I'm right.
@sarge_razor_sucks_6_b=...
@sarge_razor_sucks_7_a=Razor won't save you from the end.
@sarge_razor_sucks_8_a=The question is, what kind of man are you going to be when the end comes?
@sarge_razor_sucks_9_a=What do you want to see in the eyes of your squad?

@sarge_decent_life_caption=Be a decent man
@sarge_decent_life_1_a=I'm serious.
@sarge_decent_life_2_a=Spend those last days decently. In peace.
@sarge_decent_life_3_a=Without spilling innocent blood for nothing.
@sarge_decent_life_4_b=But ... if we're all going to die, what's the difference?
@sarge_decent_life_5_b=Nothing should matter.

@sarge_for_your_squad_caption=It's a difference for your squad
@sarge_for_your_squad_1_a=It's a difference for your squad ... and for yourself.
@sarge_for_your_squad_2_a=For your conscience.
@sarge_for_your_squad_3_a=As we live we often make mistakes.
@sarge_for_your_squad_4_a=We lose our paths.
@sarge_for_your_squad_5_a=Then find them again.
@sarge_for_your_squad_6_a=Then lose them again.
@sarge_for_your_squad_7_a=But in the end we should at least be able to say that we tried.
@sarge_for_your_squad_8_a=That we lived a good life.
@sarge_for_your_squad_9_a=As a good person.
@sarge_for_your_squad_10_a=Or we can spend our last moments remembering the faces of people we hurt.

@sarge_memory_caption=People will remember you as a good man
@sarge_memory_1_a=People will remember you as a good man.
@sarge_memory_2_b=What people? We're all going to die.
@sarge_memory_3_b=There will be nobody to remember us.
@sarge_memory_4_b=No witnesses.
@sarge_memory_5_b=I think we should take all the advantage we can get while we are still here.

@sarge_ok_1_b=You're right.
@sarge_ok_2_b=There is no point in denying it.
@sarge_ok_3_b=I'll talk to my squad.
@sarge_ok_4_b=We'll change our ways while we still can.

@sarge_reason_couldkill_caption=I could have killed you
@sarge_reason_couldkill_1_a=I saw you talking with the rest of your gang.
@sarge_reason_couldkill_2_a=Then you turned your back to me, and I could have killed you easily.
@sarge_reason_couldkill_3_b=But you didn't. What exact advantage does that currently give you?
@sarge_reason_couldkill_4_a=What I mean is...
@sarge_reason_couldkill_5_a=I ... didn't shoot you because I thought we could have a civilized talk.
@sarge_reason_couldkill_6_b=Hahahah.
@sarge_reason_couldkill_7_b=Civilized talk.
@sarge_reason_couldkill_8_b=Look around you, son.
@sarge_reason_couldkill_9_b=How much of a civilization do you see 'round yerself, huh?
@sarge_reason_couldkill_10_a=...
@sarge_reason_couldkill_11_b=Exactly. I tell you what, your attitude amuses me.
@sarge_reason_couldkill_12_b=We can talk.

@sarge_reason_sniper_caption=My friend has an aim on you.
@sarge_reason_sniper_1_a=I'm not alone. My friend aims at you as we speak from the building over there...
@sarge_reason_sniper_2_c=[Cate] Hello, sir. Please lower your gun.
@sarge_reason_sniper_3_b=Heh. Nicely played.
@sarge_reason_sniper_4_b=Yet, I think you'd have killed me already if you didn't want something first.
@sarge_reason_sniper_5_b=What is it, then?
@sarge_reason_sniper_6_a=I just want to talk.
@sarge_reason_sniper_7_b=You want to talk. Sure. I can do that.
@sarge_reason_sniper_8_b=Since I've lowered my gun, can you tell your friend to stand down, as well?
@sarge_reason_sniper_9_c=[Cate] I'll stand down when I feel like it.
@sarge_reason_sniper_10_a=Alright, so...

@sarge_reason_surrender_caption=I want to negotiate
@sarge_reason_surrender_1_a=I've come to bargain.
@sarge_reason_surrender_2_a=I want to negotiate peace ... before a war breaks out between our groups.
@sarge_reason_surrender_3_b=A war?
@sarge_reason_surrender_4_b=Listen son, I don't know what world you live in, but it's not going to be a war.
@sarge_reason_surrender_5_b=It's going to be a massacre.
@sarge_reason_surrender_6_b=You have nothing to give us that we can't take by force.
@sarge_reason_surrender_7_b=...or can you prove me wrong?
@sarge_reason_surrender_8_b=I'm listening.

@sarge_rank_caption=Are you a Sergeant?
@sarge_rank_1_a=People that were with you called you Sarge.
@sarge_rank_2_a=Are you really a Sergeant?
@sarge_rank_3_b=Hah. I used to be.
@sarge_rank_4_b=Sergeant First Class to be specific.
@sarge_rank_5_b=But that doesn't matter anymore. It's in the past.
@sarge_rank_6_b=My nickname is all I have from that life.

@sarge_troops_caption=Your squad
@sarge_troops_1_a=That guy on a bike mentioned something about "your men".
@sarge_troops_2_a=Is it your squad?
@sarge_troops_3_b=Jesus, you've been listening to all that?
@sarge_troops_4_b=Yeah it's my squad alright.
@sarge_troops_5_b=Or what's left of it. Four men.
@sarge_troops_6_b=They still take orders from me, even if we're not soldiers anymore.

@sarge_razor_caption=Who is the motorbike guy?
@sarge_razor_1_a=Who is the guy you talked to?
@sarge_razor_2_b=They call him Razor.
@sarge_razor_3_b=He is the leader of the gang.
@sarge_razor_4_b=And technically my boss.
@sarge_razor_5_b=Also a guy that will most likely kill you.
@sarge_razor_6_b=I would avoid him at all cost if I were you.

@sarge_razor_army_caption=Why do you work for Razor?
@sarge_razor_army_1_a=So ... why did you join him?
@sarge_razor_army_2_b=Are you kidding me?
@sarge_razor_army_3_b=As if I had a choice. We were alone ... me and what was left of my squad.
@sarge_razor_army_4_b=There is no more army. No HQ, no government.
@sarge_razor_army_5_b=We had nowhere to go. No supplies, no food, no shelter.
@sarge_razor_army_6_b=Razor took us in ... in exchange for our muscles.
@sarge_razor_army_7_b=Even if I'm not proud of it.

@gasstation_sarge_dont_touch_1_b=Don't touch that.
@gasstation_sarge_dont_touch_2_b=I'll need that fuel.

@thugs_gasstation_talk_0=We kill them all.
@thugs_gasstation_talk_1=Is that the best you can come up with, Razor?
@thugs_gasstation_talk_2=What's your problem, man?
@thugs_gasstation_talk_3=It's not a good plan, that's my problem.
@thugs_gasstation_talk_4=Shut up. We stick to the plan.
@thugs_gasstation_talk_5=So, we're just planning on going to their house and shooting them all dead?
@thugs_gasstation_talk_6=Yes. We'll just wait till it gets dark.
@thugs_gasstation_talk_7=Come on, can't we just scare them off?

@gasstation_hear_thugs1_1_b=Stop.
@gasstation_hear_thugs1_2_b=You hear that, David?
@gasstation_hear_thugs2_2_b=You hear that, guys?
@gasstation_hear_thugs1_3_a=Yeah. Somebody's ... talking.
@gasstation_hear_thugs1_4_b=Shh...
@gasstation_hear_thugs1_5_a=We won't catch much from here...
@gasstation_hear_thugs1_6_a=We could sneak to the shop and listen from there.

@gasstation_meet_thug_1_a=Alright Cate, you stay here.
@gasstation_meet_thug2_1_a=Alright guys, you stay here.
@gasstation_meet_thug_2_a=I might need your help in case there's trouble.
@gasstation_meet_thug_3_b=I hope you know what you're doing.

@chitchat_help_barry_cody_01_1_a=Oh god...
@chitchat_help_barry_cody_01_2_c=Help!
@chitchat_help_barry_cody_01_3_c=Help me!
@chitchat_help_barry_cody_01_4_b=Ugh. I ... I can't hold it much longer...
@chitchat_help_barry_cody_01_5_a=Hang on guys!
@chitchat_help_barry_cody_01_6_a=David, for god's sake! Help them!
@chitchat_help_barry_cody_01_7_b=Forget me! Save Cody!
@chitchat_help_barry_cody_01_8_c=Aaaah! I'm gonna fall!
@chitchat_help_barry_cody_01_9_b=Just ... save ... the boy...

@chitchat_help_barry_01_1_a=Oh god...
@chitchat_help_barry_01_2_b=Ugh ... I ... I can't hold it much longer...
@chitchat_help_barry_01_3_a=Hang on Barry!
@chitchat_help_barry_01_4_a=David, for god's sake! Help him!
@chitchat_help_barry_01_5_b=Pull ... me ... up!

@chitchat_help_cody_01_1_a=Oh god...
@chitchat_help_cody_01_2_c=Help!
@chitchat_help_cody_01_3_c=Help me!
@chitchat_help_cody_01_4_a=Hang on Cody!
@chitchat_help_cody_01_5_a=David, for god's sake! Help him!
@chitchat_help_cody_01_6_c=Aaaah! I'm gonna fall!

@chitchat_cate1_1_a=Ugh, this place stinks...
@chitchat_cate1_2_a=Or maybe that's you, David?
@chitchat_cate1_3_a=When was the last time you bathed?
@chitchat_cate2_1_a=I could kill for a coffee right now...
@chitchat_cate3_1_a=Of all the places I could have crashed into...
@chitchat_cate3_2_a=...don't mind me, just talking to myself.
@chitchat_cate4_1_a=Are you sure you know what you're doing, David?
@chitchat_cate4_2_a=Just kidding...
@chitchat_cate4_3_a=I'm sure you don't know.
@chitchat_cate5_1_a=I hate walking.
@chitchat_cate6_1_a=This place sucked even before the world was destroyed.
@chitchat_cate7_1_a=Do you even know where we're going?
@chitchat_cate7_2_a=...
@chitchat_cate7_3_a=Just as I thought.
@chitchat_cate8_1_a=You can do it Cate. Just a little longer.
@chitchat_cate8_2_a=Great. Now I'm starting to talk to myself.
@chitchat_cate9_1_a=Let me know if you find any coffee, okay?
@chitchat_cate9_2_a=I can't even remember the taste.
@chitchat_cate9_3_a=Only addiction remains...

@chitchat_cate_barry1_1_b=Who are you anyway?
@chitchat_cate_barry1_2_a=I'm Catherine?
@chitchat_cate_barry1_3_b=You know what I'm talking about. Flying a helicopter, using a gun.
@chitchat_cate_barry1_4_a=You can call it a survival instinct.
@chitchat_cate_barry1_5_b=That doesn't explain anything.
@chitchat_cate_barry1_6_a=I'm a girl who survives.

@chitchat_cate_barry2_1_a=How are you holding up?
@chitchat_cate_barry2_2_b=You don't have to pretend you care.
@chitchat_cate_barry2_3_a=That's a relief. I'm not really good when it comes to social skills.
@chitchat_cate_barry2_4_b=I already noticed that.

@chitchat_cate_barry3_1_b=If only Maggie could see me now.
@chitchat_cate_barry3_2_a=Now? You're not even doing anything special.
@chitchat_cate_barry3_3_b=No? I'm traveling with new friends, almost strangers...
@chitchat_cate_barry3_4_b=...trying to outsmart the wastelands.
@chitchat_cate_barry3_5_b=Maybe we have different definitions of what's special.

@chitchat_cate_barry4_1_a=So....
@chitchat_cate_barry4_2_a=How are you, Barry?
@chitchat_cate_barry4_3_b=You really don't have to pretend that you care, Cate..
@chitchat_cate_barry4_4_a=Oh...
@chitchat_cate_barry4_5_a=Fine then...
@chitchat_cate_barry4_6_a=I was afraid I'd have to be nice for a longer period of time.

@chitchat_cate_barry5_1_b=Hey David, maybe I'll help you carry something?
@chitchat_cate_barry5_2_a=Don't even try.
@chitchat_cate_barry5_3_a=He's a hoarder. He just loves collecting stuff.
@chitchat_cate_barry5_4_b=He just makes sure we have all the things we might need.
@chitchat_cate_barry5_5_b=And I don't want to see his back snap in half.
@chitchat_cate_barry5_6_a=He'll be fine, Barry.
@chitchat_cate_barry5_7_a=We all carry our own burdens.

@chitchat_cate_barry6_1_b=Let me know if you need my help with anything, okay?
@chitchat_cate_barry6_2_a=We know that, Barry.
@chitchat_cate_barry6_3_b=Just wanted to make it clear.
@chitchat_cate_barry6_4_b=Because I'm really grateful for what you did for me.
@chitchat_cate_barry6_5_b=If it wasn't for you...
@chitchat_cate_barry6_6_a=Don't you even start this kind of talk with me...
@chitchat_cate_barry6_7_a=I was referring mostly to David anyway.

@chitchat_cate_barry7_1_b=Where did all the people go anyway?
@chitchat_cate_barry7_2_a=What do you mean exactly?
@chitchat_cate_barry7_3_b=The world is so deserted.
@chitchat_cate_barry7_4_b=Sure, the Moon is broken and the climate is crazy, but where did all the people go?
@chitchat_cate_barry7_5_a=Most of them are dead.
@chitchat_cate_barry7_6_b=Most of them? How? I always imagined the majority survived somewhere.
@chitchat_cate_barry7_7_a=Earthquakes. Diseases. Hunger. You'd be surprised how fragile the food supply chain was.
@chitchat_cate_barry7_8_a=Also, there were resource wars. Not one war; many wars. Not a big "we vs them" conflict.
@chitchat_cate_barry7_9_a=Everyone-for-themselves backstabbing fest, between countries and inside the countries.
@chitchat_cate_barry7_10_a=There were probably more wars this year across the globe than during the entire century.
@chitchat_cate_barry7_11_a=And it's the 20th century we're talking about, so that says something.
@chitchat_cate_barry7_12_a=But, of course, it kinda went unnoticed.
@chitchat_cate_barry7_13_a=First, there is no more press so hardly anyone knows about it.
@chitchat_cate_barry7_14_a=And second, there is hardly anyone left, in general.

@chitchat_cate_barry8_1_b=Where is it? Where is it?
@chitchat_cate_barry8_2_a=What's up, Barry?
@chitchat_cate_barry8_3_b=Have you seen ... Oh, here it is.
@chitchat_cate_barry8_4_b=Maggie's locket.
@chitchat_cate_barry8_5_b=I almost lost it.
@chitchat_cate_barry8_6_a=It's just an item.
@chitchat_cate_barry8_7_b=Maybe for you.

@chitchat_cate_barry9_1_b=What do you miss, Cate?
@chitchat_cate_barry9_2_a=Huh?
@chitchat_cate_barry9_3_b=From your life before all this.
@chitchat_cate_barry9_4_b=Before the world went to hell.
@chitchat_cate_barry9_5_a=Coffee.
@chitchat_cate_barry9_6_b=That didn't take long.
@chitchat_cate_barry9_7_a=It wasn't a hard question. I miss coffee.
@chitchat_cate_barry9_8_a=If you find any, give me some.
@chitchat_cate_barry9_9_b=Okay...

@chitchat_cate_cody1_1_c=I'm bored. Play with me.
@chitchat_cate_cody1_2_a=No. I'm busy.
@chitchat_cate_cody1_3_c=But you're not doing anything...
@chitchat_cate_cody1_4_a=Still no.
@chitchat_cate_cody1_5_c=Pleeeeeease...
@chitchat_cate_cody1_6_a=Eh...
@chitchat_cate_cody1_7_c=It's a simple game. One person has to guess what the other sees. You start by saying "I spy with my little eye..."
@chitchat_cate_cody1_8_a=I spy with my little eye something beginning with the letter S.
@chitchat_cate_cody1_9_c=Sand?
@chitchat_cate_cody1_10_a=Good job, you won! Now go away.
@chitchat_cate_cody1_11_c=Yaay! Hey, wait a minute...

@chitchat_cate_cody2_1_c=Knock Knock.
@chitchat_cate_cody2_2_a=...
@chitchat_cate_cody2_3_c=Knock Knock!
@chitchat_cate_cody2_4_a=There's no one home.
@chitchat_cate_cody2_5_c=You don't know how to have fun...

@chitchat_cate_cody3_1_c=Cate, why are you so serious and scary?
@chitchat_cate_cody3_2_a=So kids won't ask me stupid questions.
@chitchat_cate_cody3_3_c=Does it really work?
@chitchat_cate_cody3_4_a=It doesn't seem to...

@chitchat_cate_cody4_1_c=♪♫ I went to the Animal Fair...
@chitchat_cate_cody4_2_c=♫♪ The birds and tigers were there!
@chitchat_cate_cody4_3_c=♪♫ The big baboon by the light of the moon...
@chitchat_cate_cody4_4_c=♫♪ Was combing his auburn hair!

@chitchat_cate_cody8_1_c=Hey, Cate?
@chitchat_cate_cody8_2_a=Yeah?
@chitchat_cate_cody8_3_c=Well...
@chitchat_cate_cody8_4_a=What is it?
@chitchat_cate_cody8_5_c=I was just wondering. Sometimes you're kind of mean to David.
@chitchat_cate_cody8_6_a=And?
@chitchat_cate_cody8_7_c=And ... well ... I just don't understand. Don't you ... like him?
@chitchat_cate_cody8_8_a=Well ... it's not that I DON'T like him...
@chitchat_cate_cody8_9_c=But you make fun of him or get angry and yell at him all the time.
@chitchat_cate_cody8_10_a=Cause sometimes he acts like a ... a goof!
@chitchat_cate_cody8_11_c=A goof?
@chitchat_cate_cody8_12_a=Yes, a goof. It means that sometimes he does stupid things.
@chitchat_cate_cody8_13_c=Oh, okay. I get it.
@chitchat_cate_cody8_14_a=Are we done here?
@chitchat_cate_cody8_15_c=Yeah, thanks. I need to think about it some more.
@chitchat_cate_cody8_16_a=As long as you do it quietly...

@chitchat_cate_cody9_1_c=Cate, I've been thinking...
@chitchat_cate_cody9_2_a=Aaaand?
@chitchat_cate_cody9_3_c=...and I still don't get it.
@chitchat_cate_cody9_4_a=What now?
@chitchat_cate_cody9_5_c=You ... why are you so mean to David sometimes?
@chitchat_cate_cody9_6_a=I thought we covered that: cause he's a dork.
@chitchat_cate_cody9_7_c=...I thought it was "goof"...
@chitchat_cate_cody9_8_a=Goof, right. Well, that's that.
@chitchat_cate_cody9_9_c=But that's why I don't get it! Wasn't he like that before?
@chitchat_cate_cody9_10_a=Before what?
@chitchat_cate_cody9_11_c=Before you and him got married.
@chitchat_cate_cody9_12_a=Ack?!
@chitchat_cate_cody9_13_c=If he was a goof, why would you marry him?
@chitchat_cate_cody9_14_a=I ... what?! I wouldn't!! I wouldn't marry him!
@chitchat_cate_cody9_15_c=Then ... did he, like ... make you marry him?
@chitchat_cate_cody9_16_a=What?
@chitchat_cate_cody9_17_c=That's what villains do! Did he pretend to be different? Or ... did he threaten you?!
@chitchat_cate_cody9_18_a=Kid, listen!
@chitchat_cate_cody9_19_c=No wonder you are mean to him.
@chitchat_cate_cody9_20_a=...I'm getting a nasty headache...

@chitchat_cate_cody7_1_c=Hey, Cate!
@chitchat_cate_cody7_2_a=Oh, no.
@chitchat_cate_cody7_3_c=Do you want to see what I found?
@chitchat_cate_cody7_4_a=No.
@chitchat_cate_cody7_5_c=It's ... aww, okay.
@chitchat_cate_cody7_6_c=But it's really neat.
@chitchat_cate_cody7_7_c=Hey, so maybe you want to guess what it is!
@chitchat_cate_cody7_8_a=Is it a pebble? Or a dead insect?
@chitchat_cate_cody7_9_c=Hmm. I'm not sure. Could be either.
@chitchat_cate_cody7_10_a=Just don't eat it, okay?

@chitchat_cate_cody6_1_c=Cate, how did the Moon explode?
@chitchat_cate_cody6_2_a=Bad people did it. By accident, but still.
@chitchat_cate_cody6_3_c=How can you break the entire Moon by accident?
@chitchat_cate_cody6_4_c=What were they doing there?
@chitchat_cate_cody6_5_a=I don't know.
@chitchat_cate_cody6_6_a=Word is they were mining.
@chitchat_cate_cody6_7_a=God knows what they found there.
@chitchat_cate_cody6_8_c=Monsters?
@chitchat_cate_cody6_9_a=Maybe.
@chitchat_cate_cody6_10_c=Ooh! You were supposed to say monsters aren't real!
@chitchat_cate_cody6_11_a=They are very real.
@chitchat_cate_cody6_12_c=David! Cate is being scary again!!!

@chitchat_cate_cody5_1_a=So, you lived in an orphanage?
@chitchat_cate_cody5_2_c=Yup!
@chitchat_cate_cody5_3_a=Was it, err, nice there?
@chitchat_cate_cody5_4_c=Not really.
@chitchat_cate_cody5_5_c=It was scary and dark.
@chitchat_cate_cody5_6_a=What?
@chitchat_cate_cody5_7_c=And spooky. If it wasn't for my plush tiger...
@chitchat_cate_cody5_8_c=I wonder where he is now...

@chitchat_cate_cody_barry1_1_c=Baarrry!
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry1_2_b=What's up kid?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry1_3_c=Why did the tiger lose at poker?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry1_4_b=I don't know. Why?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry1_5_c=Because he was playing with a cheetah!
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry1_6_b=Hah! Good one.

@chitchat_cate_cody_barry2_1_c=Barry, can you play with me? I'm bored.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry2_2_b=Sure, kid. What do you want to do?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry2_3_c=There is this simple game where one person describes what they see and the other person has to guess.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry2_4_c=I can go first!
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry2_5_b=Go ahead.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry2_6_c=I spy with my little eye something scary.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry2_7_b=Cate.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry2_8_c=How did you guess that so fast?!

@chitchat_cate_cody_barry3_1_c=...
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry3_2_b=What's the matter, kid?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry3_3_c=I'm tired.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry3_4_b=Why? Are you worried about something? Didn't get enough sleep?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry3_5_c=No ... I had bad dreams. There were those shadowy people. They were chasing me.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry3_6_b=It's only a dream. Dreams can't hurt you. Don't think about it too much.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry3_7_c=...
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry3_8_c=I think they can...

@chitchat_cate_cody_barry4_1_b=I miss you so much, Maggie.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry4_2_b=It's been only a little while ... but it feels like an eternity.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry4_3_b=I wish you were here with me.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry4_4_c=Who are you talking to, Barry?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry4_5_b=No one, kid. No one...

@chitchat_cate_cody_barry5_1_b=So kid, what do you want to be when you grow up?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry5_2_c=Hmm ... I'm not sure.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry5_3_a=Not that it matters now anyway.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry5_4_b=Policeman? Fireman? I'm sure you had some ideas.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry5_5_c=I wanted to work in a zoo. There are so many animals there! I could play with tigers!
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry5_6_b=That could be dangerous...
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry5_7_c=No. I've heard they can be really friendly!
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry5_8_b=If you say so, kid.

@chitchat_cate_cody_barry6_1_c=Do you believe in ghosts, Barry?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry6_2_b=Do you mean the afterlife? Yes, I...
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry6_3_c=No, actual ghosts!
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry6_4_b=Not really.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry6_5_c=Oh.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry6_6_c=Okay.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry6_7_c=That's good.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry6_8_b=Why do you ask...?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry6_9_c=No reason.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry6_10_b=Cody?

@chitchat_cate_cody_barry7_1_b=What do you miss, Cody?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry7_2_c=Hm?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry7_3_b=From before the world broke down like it did.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry7_4_c=Umm...
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry7_5_c=I don't know. Food?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry7_6_b=Oh, come on. There must have been something else.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry7_7_b=Like a TV show or specific type of candy.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry7_8_c=Comic books ... I miss them.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry7_9_c=And I had a toy tiger. I miss him, too.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry7_10_c=But don't say that to David or Cate. It's kinda childish.

@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_1_c=Hey, Barry.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_2_b=What's up, Cody?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_3_c=I've been thinking.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_4_a=Oh, here we go.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_5_b=Shush, Cate. What have you been thinking about?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_6_c=Maybe there's a way to stop the Moon.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_7_b=Stop the Moon?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_8_c=Yes. From falling down.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_9_b=How would you do that?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_10_c=Let's shoot it with a rocket!
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_11_c=Or a dozen rockets!
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_12_a=Believe me, Cody. A lot of very smart people tried to come up with a way to do it.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_13_c=They did?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_14_a=Yes.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_15_c=I should tell them my idea then.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_16_b=Yes. You definitely should.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_17_c=ROCKETS AWAY!
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_18_c=SWOOOSH!
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry8_19_c=SWOOOSH!!!

@chitchat_cate_cody_barry9_1_a=Eleven ... Fourteen times three...
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry9_2_c=Cate! What are you calculating?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry9_3_a=Two hundred seventy ... gah!
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry9_4_a=Why do you have to interrupt like that?!
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry9_5_c=Sorry. I was just curious.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry9_6_a=I was calculating how much fuel we will need.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry9_7_b=We have pretty much all the fuel that we could need from the gas station.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry9_8_a=I meant the rocket fuel.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry9_9_b=Wait ... you've been counting that in your head?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry9_10_a=I read the technical manual to the Sidereal's ship.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry9_11_a=It wasn't easy to get one, I might add.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry9_12_a=But as for now I know it by heart.
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry9_13_b=How do you know how much we weigh?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry9_14_b=I guess that's a factor, right?
@chitchat_cate_cody_barry9_15_a=I ... approximate.

@chitchat_2_cate_cody4_1_c=♪♫ I went to the Animal Fair...
@chitchat_2_cate_cody4_2_c=♫♪ The birds and tigers were there!
@chitchat_2_cate_cody4_3_c=♪♫ The big baboon by the light of the moon...
@chitchat_2_cate_cody4_4_a=...was combing his auburn hair?
@chitchat_2_cate_cody4_5_c=Huh? Yes! I didn't know you knew that song!
@chitchat_2_cate_cody4_6_a=I didn't know either.

@chitchat_2_cate_cody_barry5_1_b=So kid, what do you want to be when you grow up?
@chitchat_2_cate_cody_barry5_2_c=Hmm ... I'm not sure.
@chitchat_2_cate_cody_barry5_3_a=Not that it matters now anyway.
@chitchat_2_cate_cody_barry5_4_b=Policeman? Fireman? I'm sure you had some ideas.
@chitchat_2_cate_cody_barry5_5_c=I wanted to work...
@chitchat_2_cate_cody_barry5_6_b=...in a zoo?
@chitchat_2_cate_cody_barry5_7_c=Wow! How did you know?
@chitchat_2_cate_cody_barry5_8_b=Lucky guess, I think...

@chitchat_2_cate_cody_barry4_1_b=So...
@chitchat_2_cate_cody_barry4_2_b=Anyone else feel like it all happened before?
@chitchat_2_cate_cody_barry4_3_a=Not all of it. Not exactly.
@chitchat_2_cate_cody_barry4_4_c=Yeah! I feel that, too!
@chitchat_2_cate_cody_barry4_5_c=But it's all blurry and ... feels like a dream.

@chitchat_2_cate_barry2_1_a=How are you holding up?
@chitchat_2_cate_barry2_2_b=I have the weirdest deja vu right now.
@chitchat_2_cate_barry2_3_a=What...?
@chitchat_2_cate_barry2_4_b=I don't know. It's like a memory from another life.
@chitchat_2_cate_barry2_5_a=What do you remember?
@chitchat_2_cate_barry2_6_b=Ever had a dream that you forgot right after waking up?
@chitchat_2_cate_barry2_7_b=One you can only recall pieces of?
@chitchat_2_cate_barry2_8_a=Yeah...

@chitchat_2_cate4_1_a=There's going to be very little fuel in the rocket's tank.
@chitchat_2_cate4_2_a=Just barely enough.
@chitchat_2_cate4_3_a=I remember that ... dream.

@chitchat_2_cate_cody1_1_a=Huh. I just had deja vu.
@chitchat_2_cate_cody1_2_c=What? Why didn't you share it with me!
@chitchat_2_cate_cody1_3_c=I'm so hungry!
@chitchat_2_cate_cody1_4_a=Err ... deja vu, Cody. What do you think it is?
@chitchat_2_cate_cody1_5_c=Sounds like a dessert. A French one.
@chitchat_2_cate_cody1_6_a=No ... It's a feeling you get when you feel something that has already happened.
@chitchat_2_cate_cody1_7_c=I feel deja vu all the time then.
@chitchat_2_cate_cody1_8_a=Really?
@chitchat_2_cate_cody1_9_c=Yeah. I'm hungry all the time. Just like yesterday.
@chitchat_2_cate_cody1_10_a=Cody ... uh ... never mind.
@chitchat_2_cate_cody1_11_c=And the day before. Oh boy, what deja vu!

@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry1_1_c=I miss Barry...
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry1_2_a=I know. Me too. He is in a better place now.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry1_3_c=Where is a better place?
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry1_4_a=Uh ... he is with his wife.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry1_5_a=I'm sure they are both happy to see you are doing well.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry1_6_c=Maybe...

@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry2_1_a=How are you feeling?
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry2_2_c=I'm sad.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry2_3_a=We can't let what happened slow us down.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry2_4_c=But ... but Barry...
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry2_5_a=Listen, he's gone. Crying won't bring him back.

@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry3_1_a=Eh. I kinda miss that old grouch.

@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry4_1_a=That's exactly why I don't want to get attached to people.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry4_2_a=You get attached and they start dying.

@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry5_1_c=Cate, do you miss Barry, too?
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry5_2_a=Sure.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry5_3_c=You don't look sad.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry5_4_a=Listen ... I know Barry was a friend, but we barely knew him.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry5_5_a=So just get over it.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry5_6_a=Just don't think about it.

@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry6_1_c=I wonder what Barry would do now.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry6_2_a=He'd probably say something depressing.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry6_3_c=...
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry6_4_a=I'm sorry. Didn't mean to...

@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry7_1_c=Hey, Cate.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry7_2_c=Do you think Barry is in heaven?
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry7_3_a=N-...
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry7_4_a=Never know. You never know.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry7_5_c=Maybe we will see him when we go to space.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry7_6_a=Maybe.

@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry8_1_c=Hey, Barry.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry8_2_c=Do you think we'll make it to space?
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry8_3_a=Oh, no. The kid has lost it.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry8_4_a=Cody ... you know Barry didn't make it, right?
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry8_5_c=Huh? Yeah, sure. I know.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry8_6_c=I just like talking to him like he was still alive.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry8_7_c=Makes me feel better.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry8_8_c=He says hi, by the way.

@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry9_1_c=You know what I miss?
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry9_2_a=What do you miss, Cody?
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry9_3_c=I miss Barry's stories.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry9_4_c=He had, like, a story for everything.
@chitchat_cate_cody_deadbarry9_5_a=Indeed he did.

@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody1_1_a=Are you okay?
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody1_2_b=No. It should have been me, not the kid.
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody1_3_a=You have a better chance of surviving.
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody1_4_b=So?
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody1_5_a=You are also more crucial to achieving our goal.
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody1_6_b=Of course you would say something like that...

@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody2_1_b=Damn it, Cody.
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody2_2_b=Why did you have to go...?

@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody3_1_a=Eh ... I guess I do miss that brat a bit.

@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody4_1_b=He was a good kid. Cody, I mean.
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody4_2_b=I miss him.
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody4_3_a=...
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody4_4_a=Yeah, I know.
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody4_5_a=Me too.

@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody5_1_b=Huh. I'm sure Cody would say something funny right now...

@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody6_1_b=First Maggie, then Cody...
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody6_2_b=I'm glad it'll all be over soon...

@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody7_1_b=Do you think he also feels the blame?
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody7_2_a=What? Who?
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody7_3_b=David. For Cody's death.
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody7_4_a=Oh, god...
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody7_5_a=Why don't you ask him yourself?
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody7_6_b=Wouldn't that sound like I'm looking for a fight?
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody7_7_b=I appreciate all he does for us.
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody7_8_b=I don't have any quarrel with him.
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody7_9_a=Sounds like maybe you do.

@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody8_1_b=I couldn't protect Maggie.
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody8_2_b=I couldn't protect Cody.
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody8_3_a=Barry?
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody8_4_b=Yes?
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody8_5_a=Please ... just stop.
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody8_6_a=Just shut up.

@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody9_1_b=This place has seen much better days.
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody9_2_a=You don't say.
@chitchat_cate_barry_deadcody9_3_b=Just stating a fact...

@lodge_back_corpse_1_a=It's crawling with maggots. I think I'm gonna throw up.
@lodge_back_corpse_2_b=Aww. Should I hold your hand?
@lodge_back_corpse_3_a=God damn it, Cate. This is sickening.
@lodge_back_corpse_4_b=Alright, it stinks like hell. I'll give you that.

@lodge_back_corpse_cody_1_C=Yuck!!! It smells like, I don't know, worse than anything.
@lodge_back_corpse_barry_1_C=I agree with David. The smell is revolting.

@outpost_elevator_fuse_done_first_1_b=Well, finally. What took you so long?
@outpost_elevator_fuse_done_first_2_Cody=Why didn't we just jump over it?
@outpost_elevator_fuse_done_first_3_Barry=It's better to be cautious.

@outpost_elevator_fuse_done_1_a=The elevator is powered, doormat is disabled...
@outpost_elevator_fuse_done_2_a=I don't think there's any point in messing with fuses any further.
@outpost_elevator_fuse_done_3_b=Yeah, we've got far more important things to do.

@outpost_spaceship_discovered_Cody_1=WOW!!!
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_A_1_a=There it is.
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_Cody_2=LOOK AT THAT!!!
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_Barry_1=Incredible.
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_B_1_b=I told you it'd be here.
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_Cody_3=IT'S A SPACESHIP!
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_C_1_b=I'm sure you hadn't doubted me for a second.
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_Barry_2=Actually, I did.
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_Barry_3=I apologize.
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_D_1_a=I admit ... this looks impressive.
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_D_2_a=It's like a regular space shuttle but smaller ... and more fancy. It IS promising.
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_Cody_4=Can we go inside?!
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_E_1_b=Don't celebrate just yet.
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_E_2_b=There's space for two rockets in this silo. See?
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_E_3_b=One launch pad is empty.
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_E_4_a=So they took one shuttle and left the other one behind.
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_Barry_4=Why? They could have saved twice as many people.
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_F_1_a=Why?
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_G_1_b=Maybe one was sufficient.
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_G_2_b=Remember, they weren't trying to save as many people as possible. They were just saving who they thought was worth saving.
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_G_3_b=Or the other one was broken.
@outpost_spaceship_discovered_G_4_b=Anyway, a bit of time has passed. The ship requires a general inspection before it's even remotely safe to use.

@airplane_welcome_1_a=That must have been a tough landing.
@airplane_welcome_2_b=Believe me I've seen worse.
@airplane_welcome_3_a=I don't doubt that.
@airplane_welcome_4_b=The plane seems to be mostly intact, so it's a good landing in my book.
@airplane_welcome_5_a=Did it belong to the Sidereal fleet?
@airplane_welcome_6_b=Most likely.
@airplane_welcome_7_b=And whatever it was carrying might still be on board. Come on.
@airplane_welcome_barry_1_c=Wait, are you not curious to find out why it crashed?
@airplane_welcome_barry_2_b=Right after the lunar explosion there was a huge disruption in Earth's magnetic field. Most of the navigation systems went crazy. Planes were falling from the sky all over the world.
@airplane_welcome_cody_1_c=I liked the spaceship better.
@airplane_welcome_cody_2_c=Can we go back to the spaceship?
@airplane_welcome_cody_3_a=Later, okay?
@airplane_welcome_cody_4_c=Ugh!!!

@outpost_silo_far1_1_a=A silo. A pair of silos, actually.
@outpost_silo_far1_2_b=Yes. One of them still houses a rocket with a shuttle.
@outpost_silo_far1_3_a=How do you know?
@outpost_silo_far1_4_a=Why didn't they take both when evacuating?
@outpost_silo_far1_5_b=I just know they didn't. Trust me.
@outpost_silo_far1_cody=I trust you!
@outpost_silo_far1_barry=I have trouble trusting you.

@outpost_silo_far2_1_a=Shouldn't at least one of the silos be open now that they've left?
@outpost_silo_far2_2_b=It closes automatically to prevent unauthorized access.
@outpost_silo_far2_3_a=Like a garage door?
@outpost_silo_far2_4_b=See? It wasn't that hard.

@outpost_base_far_1_a=This outpost ... doesn't look particularly large.
@outpost_base_far_2_b=That's just the entrance.
@outpost_base_far_3_b=Most of the base is underground.

@outpost_silo_far3_1_a=A silo. This one turned out to be empty.

@outpost_silo_far4_1_a=A silo. It has our ship inside.

@outpost_base_far2_1_a=The outpost. It sure is bigger on the inside.

@outpost_doormat_1_b=<WARNING> ^<DEFENSE SYSTEMS ACTIVATED>
@outpost_doormat_2_b=<PROVIDE A VALID ID CARD>
@outpost_doormat_3_b=<YOU HAVE 5 SECONDS TO COMPLY>
@outpost_doormat_cate=This doesn't sound good.
@outpost_doormat_barry=Be careful, David...
@outpost_doormat_cody=Aaaaa!

@outpost_ship_crack_in_1_a=Oh ... a crack in the wall.
@outpost_ship_crack_in_2_a=This can't be good, right?
@outpost_ship_crack_in_3_b=How big is it?
@outpost_ship_crack_in_4_a=I don't know, like, palm-sized?
@outpost_ship_crack_in_5_a=No idea how deep it runs. Maybe it's just on the surface?
@outpost_ship_crack_in_6_b=If it's any deeper we might be in trouble.
@outpost_ship_crack_in_7_b=Best case scenario, we will lose oxygen.
@outpost_ship_crack_in_8_a=And the worst case?
@outpost_ship_crack_in_9_b=We explode during the ascent.
@outpost_ship_crack_in_10_a=Oh.

@outpost_ship_crack_out_1_a=Hey ... this fin is cracked.
@outpost_ship_crack_out_2_a=This can't be good, right?
@outpost_ship_crack_out_3_b=What? Where?!
@outpost_ship_crack_out_4_a=Here, see?
@outpost_ship_crack_out_5_a=You think it's serious?
@outpost_ship_crack_out_6_b=Looks like it might be.
@outpost_ship_crack_out_7_b=Best case scenario, we will lose a lot of thrust from air resistance.
@outpost_ship_crack_out_8_a=And the worst case?
@outpost_ship_crack_out_9_b=We explode during the ascent.
@outpost_ship_crack_out_10_a=Oh.

@airplane_cody_a_1_c=Is this person dead?
@airplane_cody_a_2_a=It would seem so, kid.
@airplane_cody_a_3_a=Let's see if he had something that might be useful to us...

@airplane_cody_b_1_c=W-wait.
@airplane_cody_b_2_c=What if he comes back to life?
@airplane_cody_b_3_c=AND BITES YOU?
@airplane_cody_b_4_a=Cody...
@airplane_cody_b_5_b=Relax, David is a professional.
@airplane_cody_b_6_b=He has searched like a dozen corpses.

@airplane_cody_c_1_c=Aaaaa!
@airplane_cody_c_2_a=What? What happened?!
@airplane_cody_c_3_c=DID IT JUST MOVE?
@airplane_cody_c_4_a=Cody...
@airplane_cody_c_5_b=Wanna wait outside, Cody?
@airplane_cody_c_6_c=No, I want to see that...

@outpost_empty_pad_1_a=This launchpad is empty. To put it simply, that ship has sailed.
@outpost_empty_pad_2_b=Or lifted off, to be more precise.

@radar_broken_1_c=ERROR: System failure
@radar_broken_2_a=Well, the radar won't be any useful to us anyway, right?
@radar_broken_3_b=Probably not. But on the other hand...
@radar_broken_4_a=I mean, it's not like there are any planes left in the air.
@radar_broken_5_b=Or helicopters.
@radar_broken_6_b=But who knows, David, who knows.

@radar_repaired_1_a=What the...
@radar_repaired_2_a=An airplane? An actual, flying airplane?
@radar_repaired_3_b=Wait a second.
@radar_repaired_4_a=Okay ... why?
@radar_repaired_5_b=Hush.
@radar_repaired_6_b=...
@radar_repaired_7_b=See any difference?
@radar_repaired_8_a=No. Should I?
@radar_repaired_9_b=Yes, if it was flying you'd see it move.
@radar_repaired_10_b=It's not airborne.
@radar_repaired_11_a=I thought radar was supposed to be detecting things up in the sky.
@radar_repaired_12_b=Yes. It also detects active transponders. Beacons installed in aircrafts.
@radar_repaired_13_a=So ... we're looking at a possible location of an airplane on the ground?
@radar_repaired_14_b=Yes. Somebody didn't disable their transponder, which might indicate a crash.
@radar_repaired_15_b=Give me your map. I'll estimate its position based on the radar's readings.

@radar_repaired2_1_a=The plane is still there, in the wastelands.
@radar_repaired2_2_a=Cate has already plotted its position on my map.

@radar_disabled_1_a=The radar doesn't detect anything else.

@thug_kill_or_not_1_a=Cate? What are you doing?
@thug_kill_or_not_2_b=What needs to be done.
@thug_kill_or_not_3_a=We agreed to let him live.
@thug_kill_or_not_4_b=No. We agreed to decide his fate in the morning.
@thug_kill_or_not_5_b=It's the morning now, and I'm deciding his fate for you.
@thug_kill_or_not_6_b=Because I know you couldn't do it.

@thug_kill_not_1_b=Damn you, David.
@thug_kill_not_2_b=You're too soft. I hope I'm not going to regret that.
@thug_kill_not_3_c=Thank you...
@thug_kill_not_4_c=Just let me go. You'll never see me again...
@thug_kill_not_5_b=Shut up.
@thug_kill_not_6_a=You're doing the right thing.
@thug_kill_not_7_b=You shut up, too.
@thug_kill_not_8_b=Everybody, just shut up.

@thug_kill_or_not_barry_1_c=There's no reasoning with her now, David.
@thug_kill_or_not_barry_2_b=Shut up, Barry.
@thug_kill_or_not_barry_3_b=You know there's no other way this can end.

@thug_kill_or_not_cody_1_c=Cate, please stop!
@thug_kill_or_not_cody_2_b=David, take him outside.

@thug_kill_yes_caption=Kill him.
@thug_kill_yes_1_a=Alright ... I guess it doesn't matter anyway.
@thug_kill_yes_2_a=The world is ending.
@thug_kill_yes_3_a=So, just go ahead and do it.
@thug_kill_yes_4_c=N-no, wait...
@thug_kill_yes_5_b=Shut up.
@thug_kill_yes_6_c=I can help you, if you just...
@thug_kill_yes_7_a=You've done enough, Razor.
@thug_kill_yes_cody=You've killed an innocent boy.
@thug_kill_yes_barry=You've killed a good man.
@thug_kill_yes_8_a=You can only do harm.
@thug_kill_yes_9_a=Even if the world is about to end, there is no place in it for trash like you.
@thug_kill_yes_10_a=Just do it, Cate.
@thug_kill_yes_11_b=Wait outside.
@thug_kill_yes_11_b_cody=Take the boy and wait outside.

@thug_kill_no_caption=Don't kill him.
@thug_kill_no_1_a=Wait ... don't do it.
@thug_kill_no_2_b=Give me one good reason.
@thug_kill_no_3_c=I will help you...I...
@thug_kill_no_4_b=Shut up, I wasn't asking you.

@thug_kill_waste_caption=It's a waste of a bullet.
@thug_kill_waste_1_a=It's a waste of a bullet. We might need to defend ourselves.
@thug_kill_waste_2_b=Hmm.
@thug_kill_waste_3_b=I could still just smack his head with a pipe until his brain comes out.

@thug_kill_lesson_caption=He's learned his lesson.
@thug_kill_lesson_1_a=He's learned his lesson. He doesn't have anyone left.
@thug_kill_lesson_2_b=That's good if you ask me.
@thug_kill_lesson_3_b=But I like to finish what I started. And there is one more vermin to terminate.

@thug_kill_better_caption=You're better than this.
@thug_kill_better_1_a=You're better than this.
@thug_kill_better_2_b=You don't know me.
@thug_kill_better_3_b=I'm a girl who survives, David. And I'll do whatever it takes.

@thug_kill_end_anyway_caption=The world ends anyway.
@thug_kill_end_anyway_1_a=It's over anyway.
@thug_kill_end_anyway_2_c=Huh?
@thug_kill_end_anyway_3_a=The world is going to end today.
@thug_kill_end_anyway_4_b=So what? This scum doesn't deserve to witness it.
@thug_kill_end_anyway_5_c=Wait, what? You're for real?
@thug_kill_end_anyway_6_b=We've been guarding him for the entire night, taking turns.
@thug_kill_end_anyway_7_b=And that was the last night of my life.
@thug_kill_end_anyway_8_b=Thanks, David.
@thug_kill_end_anyway_9_b=We should have killed him right away.

@day4_intro_talk_kill_1_a=Maybe this is for the better.
@day4_intro_talk_kill_2_b=Sure it is.
@day4_intro_talk_kill_3_b=Razor won't be bothering us anymore.

@day4_intro_talk_no_kill_1_b=I hope letting him go won't turn out to be a mistake.
@day4_intro_talk_no_kill_2_a=That was the right thing to do.
@day4_intro_talk_no_kill_3_b=I'll ask you to say that again if he follows us and stabs our backs when we least expect it.
@day4_intro_talk_no_kill_4_a=I doubt he would.
@day4_intro_talk_no_kill_5_b=...

@day4_intro_talk_1_a=So. It is today.
@day4_intro_talk_2_b=Is it?
@day4_intro_talk_3_a=Yes. I've seen it. This time there is no way to survive this.
@day4_intro_talk_4_b=We know where the ship is.
@day4_intro_talk_5_a=Come on, Cate. How is that going to save us?
@day4_intro_talk_6_a=Maybe if you tell me more about that space station, the story would be more believable.
@day4_intro_talk_7_a=But so far?
@day4_intro_talk_8_b=Just a little longer, David.
@day4_intro_talk_9_b=Let's go to that outpost. It's pretty far away, so we'd better take a car.

@day4_intro_talk_barry_1_a=Barry, how do you feel?
@day4_intro_talk_barry_2_c=How should I feel? My wife is dead, I've had the worst night of my life and the world is about to end.
@day4_intro_talk_barry_2_c_no_cody=How should I feel? My wife is dead, the kid we looked after died, I've had the worst night of my life and the world is about to end.
@day4_intro_talk_barry_3_a=Hang in there. Things are going to get better.
@day4_intro_talk_barry_4_c=I don't know, David. This whole thing about the spaceship.
@day4_intro_talk_barry_5_c=It's too good to be true.
@day4_intro_talk_barry_6_c=Not to mention I'm terrified of flying. I take trains.
@day4_intro_talk_barry_7_b=Don't worry. You'll see I'm not bluffing.

@day4_intro_talk_cody_1_c=And is there going to be a spaceship?
@day4_intro_talk_cody_2_b=Yes!
@day4_intro_talk_cody_3_c=Like, a real one? And we're going into space?
@day4_intro_talk_cody_4_b=Exactly!
@day4_intro_talk_cody_5_c=I want to go to spaaace!
@day4_intro_talk_cody_6_c=Woooo!

@can_launch_1_a=Are we ready to launch?
@can_launch_2_b=Ready when you are, David.

@cant_launch_hatch_1_a=Are we ready to launch?
@cant_launch_hatch_2_b=David, the silo's hatch is still closed.
@cant_launch_hatch_3_b=We can't launch until we find a way to open it.
@cant_launch_hatch_4_b=Or do you want us to crash even before we take off?

@cant_launch_weight_1_a=Are we ready to launch?
@cant_launch_weight_2_b=I've made some calculations, and we barely have enough fuel to get to our destination.
@cant_launch_weight_3_b=We have to limit our weight.
@cant_launch_weight_4_b=...and you seem to be carrying a lot of stuff with you.
@cant_launch_weight_5_a=I like picking things up. You never know when you're gonna need a water sprayer.
@cant_launch_weight_6_b=Well, now you have to say goodbye to your belongings. Take only things that weigh, say, one kilogram in total.
@cant_launch_weight_7_a=One kilogram. Fine.

@cant_launch_welder_1_a=Are we ready to launch?
@cant_launch_welder_2_b=Almost. Just get rid of that welding kit from the deck. It weighs a ton.

@bus_intro_1_a=It has the Sidereal logo on it.
@bus_intro_2_a=They were using this bus to move their people to the launch site.
@bus_intro_3_b=Too bad their driver didn't know how to drive.
@bus_intro_4_b=Looks like they abandoned it here and continued on foot.
@bus_intro_5_a=Maybe they left something valuable behind.

@outpost_intro_1_b=There it is.
@outpost_intro_2_a=You mean ... this?
@outpost_intro_3_b=What did you expect?
@outpost_intro_4_b=I told you. The location of this facility was confidential. Don't look for any bright neon lights or signposts.
@outpost_intro_5_a=Yeah, but still...
@outpost_intro_6_b=Come on, the whole place is underground. We have to get inside.
@outpost_intro_7_b=There ... might be security measures waiting for us.
@outpost_intro_8_a=Great.

@ginger_fingerprint_caption=Could you scan your finger?
@ginger_fingerprint_1_a=There's a finger scanner on that door.
@ginger_fingerprint_2_b=Yeah, so?
@ginger_fingerprint_3_a=So ... since you know so much about Sidereal I thought you could...
@ginger_fingerprint_4_b=David, I...
@ginger_fingerprint_5_a=Oh, come on. You wouldn't have any idea about this place if you weren't somehow involved.
@ginger_fingerprint_6_b=Even if I was, do you think I'd still be here if I was important enough for them to save me?
@ginger_fingerprint_7_a=Humor me.

@moon_reveal_1_a=Cate. What is that?
@moon_reveal_2_b=Uh, a trajectory map?
@moon_reveal_3_a=Why does it go to the Moon?
@moon_reveal_4_a=We are not going to the Moon, are we?
@moon_reveal_5_a=You said we're going to a space station.
@moon_reveal_6_b=I never said the space station wasn't on the Moon.
@outpost_travel_reveal_Cody_1=WHAT!? But the Moon is going to...!
@outpost_travel_reveal_Barry_1=That's just crazy. I knew you were crazy.
@moon_reveal_7_a=You've gotta be kidding.
@moon_reveal_8_a=Please tell me you are.
@moon_reveal_9_b=...
@moon_reveal_10_a=Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the Moon going to hit us in less than twelve hours?
@moon_reveal_11_a=Why the hell would we want to go there?!
@moon_reveal_12_b=It's the only way. You have to believe me.
@moon_reveal_13_a=I don't know if I have any reasons to believe you.
@moon_reveal_14_a=You promised us safety. You promised us an escape.
@moon_reveal_15_a=You said you wanted to leave this planet.
@moon_reveal_16_b=Those aren't the exact words I used.
@outpost_travel_reveal_Barry_2=I think we deserve some answers.
@moon_reveal_17_b=How can I explain it to you?
@moon_reveal_18_b=There is something in that Moon base that will help us. Sidereal has a base there...
@moon_reveal_19_a=What could possibly help us if we reach the Moon an hour before impact?

@moon_reveal_20_a=And wasn't their Moon base destroyed in the mining accident?
@moon_reveal_21_b=It was. But they have another base on the Moon. It's called Sidereal Plexus One and they ... how should I put this?

@moon_reveal_22_b=How do you think Sidereal has all this technology?
@moon_reveal_23_b=Private space shuttles. Moon bases. Electric doormats. Weather drones. Heat absorbers.
@moon_reveal_24_b=The means to accidentally blow up the whole damn Moon.
@moon_reveal_25_a=I'm not sure I follow.
@moon_reveal_26_b=They're getting that technology from other worlds.
@moon_reveal_27_a=Like ... other planets?
@moon_reveal_28_b=No. Other Earths. They are in contact with other versions of Sidereal Plexus.
@moon_reveal_29_b=A vast network of connections, across the endless universes.
@moon_reveal_30_b=Constantly discovering new versions of the world as they go.
@moon_reveal_31_b=Our world is merely one page in an enormous library of worlds they have access to.
@moon_reveal_32_a=Do you expect me to believe all that?
@moon_reveal_33_b=I don't really care if you do.
@moon_reveal_34_b=Help me off this planet or get out of the way.

@moon_reveal_barry_1_c=You have some nerve to mock us like that.
@moon_reveal_barry_2_c=After all we've been through.
@moon_reveal_barry_3_b=Barry, like I said I don't care if you believe me or not.
@moon_reveal_barry_4_b=And I don't need your help.
@moon_reveal_barry_5_c=Just to be clear, I'm helping David, not you.

@moon_reveal_cody_1_c=Please don't fight...
@moon_reveal_cody_2_c=Even if we're going to die, we can be together...
@moon_reveal_cody_3_c=Right?
@moon_reveal_cody_4_c=I...
@moon_reveal_cody_5_c=...I don't want to be alone again.

@ship_enter_intro_1_b=So ... how does it look?
@ship_enter_intro_2_a=You tell me. I don't know much about spaceships.
@ship_enter_intro_3_a=I always imagined it would be more ... horizontal.
@ship_enter_intro_4_b=It can be confusing, but the ship will rotate to horizontal position after we launch.
@ship_enter_intro_5_a=Still, it kinda looks like some sort of a space bus with all those seats.
@ship_enter_intro_6_b=Its purpose was to drive people to and from the Moon. It kinda IS a space bus.
@ship_enter_intro_7_b=Anyway, look around for any systems that seem to be missing.
@ship_enter_intro_8_a=How will I know if a system is missing if it is not there?
@ship_enter_intro_9_b=Come on, David. You're smart. It's not rocket sci-
@ship_enter_intro_10_b=Well, actually it kinda is.

@ship_closet_1_a=Hey ... Cate?
@ship_closet_2_b=Yeah?
@ship_closet_3_a=I found some space suits.
@ship_closet_4_b=Good. Those are emergency suits in case the shuttle fails to dock to the Moon base.
@ship_closet_5_a=Should I take them?
@ship_closet_6_b=No, leave them there for now. We might need them later.

@moon_shocked_cody1_1_a=Cody, you okay?
@moon_shocked_cody1_2_b=Uhh ... I don't know.
@moon_shocked_cody1_3_a=Can you stand?
@moon_shocked_cody1_4_b=I think...
@moon_shocked_cody1_5_b=What's that sound?
@moon_shocked_cody1_6_b=Are we going to die?

@moon_shocked_cody2_1_a=No, of course not.
@moon_shocked_cody2_2_b=Where is Cate?
@moon_shocked_cody2_3_a=She ... didn't make it.
@moon_shocked_cody2_4_b=N-no...!
@moon_shocked_cody2_5_b=*sniff*

@moon_shocked_barry1_1_a=Barry, are you hurt?
@moon_shocked_barry1_2_b=I don't think so. Just some bruises.
@moon_shocked_barry1_3_a=Try to stand up.
@moon_shocked_barry1_4_a=We have to move.

@moon_shocked_barry2_1_b=Is Cate okay?
@moon_shocked_barry2_2_a=She ... didn't make it...
@moon_shocked_barry2_3_b=I'm ... I'm sorry.
@moon_shocked_barry2_4_a=Yeah, me too.

@moon_shocked_cate_1_a=Cate, are you alright?
@moon_shocked_cate_2_b=Uhh ... that wasn't one of my best landings.
@moon_shocked_cate_3_a=I've never seen you do any better.
@moon_shocked_cate_4_b=Could be worse though, couldn't it?
@moon_shocked_cate_5_b=In my defense, it was my first time landing on the Moon.

@moon_dead_cate1_1_a=Cate...?
@moon_dead_cate1_2_a=Oh, god ... oh, no ...
@moon_dead_cate1_3_b=*cough cough*
@moon_dead_cate1_4_b=That ... landing ...
@moon_dead_cate1_5_a=Don't move, Cate.
@moon_dead_cate1_6_b=I messed it up, David.
@moon_dead_cate1_7_a=You did all you could.
@moon_dead_cate1_8_a=We didn't have enough fuel to land safely.
@moon_dead_cate1_9_b=Maybe if we had prepared better...

@moon_dead_cate_cody_1_b=Is Cody okay?
@moon_dead_cate_cody_2_a=Yes. I think he is fine. Don't worry.

@moon_dead_cate_barry_1_b=Is Barry okay?
@moon_dead_cate_barry_2_a=Yes. I think he is fine. Don't worry.

@moon_dead_cate_both_1_b=Are the others okay?
@moon_dead_cate_both_2_a=Yes. I think they are fine. Don't worry.

@moon_dead_cate2_1_b=So...
@moon_dead_cate2_2_b=Looks like this is the end of the road for me.
@moon_dead_cate2_3_a=No way, Cate. I'll carry you if I have to.
@moon_dead_cate2_4_b=Hah ... *cough*
@moon_dead_cate2_5_b=Don't make me laugh. I'm done for.
@moon_dead_cate2_6_b=Listen very carefully.
@moon_dead_cate2_7_b=Lean in ... please. It's hard to speak.
@moon_dead_cate2_8_b=You've gotta use a space suit to get to the station.
@moon_dead_cate2_9_b=When you're there ... look for ... 
@moon_dead_cate2_10_b=Sleeper Pods.
@moon_dead_cate2_11_b=That's your way out.
@moon_dead_cate2_12_b=Dream...
@moon_dead_cate2_13_b=and...
@moon_dead_cate2_14_a=Cate...?
@moon_dead_cate2_15_a=Cate.

@moon_dead_cate3_cody_1_b=Cate...!
@moon_dead_cate3_cody_1_b=*sniff*

@moon_dead_cate3_barry_1_b=Goodbye, Cate...

@moon_shocked_cate_ending=We're losing air, David. Now is the time to use the space suits.
@moon_shocked_nocate_ending=The ship is losing air fast.

@moonbase1_intro_cate_p1_1_b=Alright, I think it's safe to remove the suits.
@moonbase1_intro_cate_p1_2_a=Great, because I'm almost out of oxygen...
@moonbase1_intro_cate_p2_1_a=Okay, so ... what now?
@moonbase1_intro_cate_p2_2_b=Let's look around.

@moonbase1_intro_no_cate_p1_1_a=I think it's safe to remove that thing...
@moonbase1_intro_no_cate_p2_1_a=Hello?
@moonbase1_intro_no_cate_p2_2_a=Anyone here?
@moonbase1_intro_no_cate_p2_3_a=...
@moonbase1_intro_no_cate_p2_4_a=Wait, what's this?
@moonbase1_intro_no_cate_p2_5_a=Something is in my pocket...
@moonbase1_intro_no_cate_p2_6_a=A note. Did Cate slip it in during our last talk?

@moonbase2_intro_no_cate_1_a=What ... are those?!
@moonbase2_intro_no_cate_2_a=Some sort of hibernation pods?
@moonbase2_intro_no_cate_3_a=Those people are sleeping...
@moonbase2_intro_no_cate_4_a=Cate said something about "Sleeper Pods"...
@moonbase2_intro_no_cate_5_a=Is this really the way out?
@moonbase2_intro_no_cate_6_a=Some sort of ... mind transference?

@moonbase2_intro_cate_1_a=What ... are those?
@moonbase2_intro_cate_2_a=Cate?
@moonbase2_intro_cate_3_b=Sleeper pods.
@moonbase2_intro_cate_4_a=Why are people here? You said they all left.
@moonbase2_intro_cate_5_a=You said they went to a different dimension or something.
@moonbase2_intro_cate_6_b=They did. This is what they left behind.
@moonbase2_intro_cate_7_a=Cate, you said they escaped!
@moonbase2_intro_cate_8_b=They did, David. Check out their neural activity monitors.
@moonbase2_intro_cate_9_b=They are flat. Because their bodies are here, sleeping.
@moonbase2_intro_cate_10_b=But their minds ... left this place. They traveled through the Realm of Dreams and already woke up in safety, months ago.
@moonbase2_intro_cate_11_b=Pods just sustain their empty bodies here.
@moonbase2_intro_cate_12_b=Not that it's required, but if for any reason anyone wanted to get back, they still can. At least for now.

@moonbase2_postintro_1_a=Wait ... I've got some questions.

@moonbase2_sleeper_pods_caption=Sleeper pods
@moonbase2_sleeper_pods_1_a=So ... it's some sort of hibernation?
@moonbase2_sleeper_pods_2_b=Yes, so the body doesn't die while the consciousness is elsewhere.

@moonbase2_body_dies_caption=What happens if the body dies?
@moonbase2_body_dies_1_a=What happens if the body dies?
@moonbase2_body_dies_2_b=In any normal circumstances, your mind would die, too.
@moonbase2_body_dies_3_b=But Sidereal has discovered something. I don't know what it is exactly, but they can completely separate the mind from the body.
@moonbase2_body_dies_4_b=So when the Moon hits Earth and everything here blows up, it won't matter to them.

@moonbase2_realm_of_dreams_caption=Realm of Dreams?
@moonbase2_realm_of_dreams_1_a=Realm of Dreams?
@moonbase2_realm_of_dreams_2_b=A poetic name, but quite graphic.
@moonbase2_realm_of_dreams_3_b=Sidereal has discovered that the human mind is capable of accessing this ... place.
@moonbase2_realm_of_dreams_4_b=A vast network, connecting every mind. As it later turned out, it reached far beyond every mind in the world.
@moonbase2_realm_of_dreams_5_b=It can connect minds across universes.

@moonbase2_intro_end_1_b=So, that's our way out.
@moonbase2_intro_end_2_b=We get into those pods and we dream our way out of here.
@moonbase2_intro_end_3_b=Wake up somewhere safe.
@moonbase2_intro_end_4_a=I'm not sure how I feel about that idea.
@moonbase2_intro_end_5_a=But then again ... what do we have to lose?

@moonbase2_pods_open_end_1_b=We have no other choice, David.
@moonbase2_pods_open_end_2_b=We've got to use those pods, whether they're fully operational or not.
@moonbase2_pods_open_end_3_a=Can't we fix the damaged systems?
@moonbase2_pods_open_end_4_b=Even if we knew how, it would probably take days. We definitely don't have that much time.
@moonbase2_pods_open_end_5_b=Let's do this.
@moonbase2_pods_open_end_6_b=Quick. This whole place is falling apart.

@ginger_moon_pods_emergency_intro_no_cate_1_a=I wonder what that means...
@ginger_moon_pods_emergency_intro_no_cate_2_a=If only Cate was here.

@ginger_moon_pods_emergency_intro_cate_1_b=Oh, no.
@ginger_moon_pods_emergency_intro_cate_2_b=No, no, no.
@ginger_moon_pods_emergency_intro_cate_3_b=Check that again. Maybe it was just a glitch.
@ginger_moon_pods_emergency_intro_cate_4_a=It still says "phase controller corrupted".
@ginger_moon_pods_emergency_intro_cate_5_b=It has already happened. It keeps happening.
@ginger_moon_pods_emergency_intro_cate_6_a=Cate? You're not making any sense...

@ginger_moon_pods_phase_controller_caption=What's the "phase controller"?
@ginger_moon_pods_phase_controller_1_a=What's the "phase controller"?
@ginger_moon_pods_phase_controller_2_b=It's a system designed to transmit human consciousness to a selected target.
@ginger_moon_pods_phase_controller_3_a=Target? A human in another world?
@ginger_moon_pods_phase_controller_4_b=Yes. Usually an otherwise braindead clone they've prepared especially for this purpose.
@ginger_moon_pods_phase_controller_5_b=...or a patient in a coma, in the worlds like ours, where cloning has not been developed yet.
@ginger_moon_pods_phase_controller_6_b=This is how they used to navigate between worlds.
@ginger_moon_pods_phase_controller_7_b=Go to sleep here, target a sleeping human vessel in another world and wake up there.
@ginger_moon_pods_phase_controller_8_a=I'm not sure if this is more terrifying or more unbelievable.
@ginger_moon_pods_phase_controller_9_b=If that controller is disabled, we can't select a target body or world.

@ginger_moon_pods_emergency_merge_mode_caption=What's the "emergency merge mode"?
@ginger_moon_pods_emergency_merge_mode_1_a=So what's the "emergency merge mode"?
@ginger_moon_pods_emergency_merge_mode_2_b=When the primary phase controller is disabled, a backup system kicks in.
@ginger_moon_pods_emergency_merge_mode_3_b=It targets a random world and a random sleeping person.
@ginger_moon_pods_emergency_merge_mode_4_a=Without their consent?
@ginger_moon_pods_emergency_merge_mode_5_b=Yes.
@ginger_moon_pods_emergency_merge_mode_6_b=However, for some reason, when this happens you almost always end up in your own body. But in a different world.

@ginger_moon_pods_where_caption=Where will we go?
@ginger_moon_pods_where_1_a=Where will we go?
@ginger_moon_pods_where_2_b=Well, without the phase controller, two things can happen.
@ginger_moon_pods_where_3_b=We can end up in limbo, in the dream world, without bodies to return to.
@ginger_moon_pods_where_4_b=Or we can wake up in our own bodies in a different world. A different version of our world.
@ginger_moon_pods_where_5_a=Like ... one where all this never happened?
@ginger_moon_pods_where_6_a=A world where there was no lunar explosion in 1996?
@ginger_moon_pods_where_7_b=Hopefully.
@ginger_moon_pods_where_8_b=...
@ginger_moon_pods_where_9_b=Yes, hopefully.

@ginger_moon_pods_lockdown_caption=The controls are locked.
@ginger_moon_pods_lockdown_1_a=The controls are locked.
@ginger_moon_pods_lockdown_2_b=We've gotta unlock them, fast.
@ginger_moon_pods_lockdown_3_b=I think it can be done in the control room.
@ginger_moon_pods_lockdown_4_a=If you say so.

@ginger_moon_pods_loop1_caption=What do you mean "it has already happened"?
@ginger_moon_pods_loop1_1_a=What do you mean "it has already happened"?
@ginger_moon_pods_loop1_2_b=I'm ... not sure.
@ginger_moon_pods_loop1_3_b=The dreams we both had.
@ginger_moon_pods_loop1_4_b=Warning you about incoming threats.
@ginger_moon_pods_loop1_5_b=Showing me where the Sidereal office building was.
@ginger_moon_pods_loop1_6_b=Those might have been our own memories. From our past lives.
@ginger_moon_pods_loop1_7_b=That would mean I've been through this.
@ginger_moon_pods_loop1_8_b=We all have.

@ginger_moon_pods_paradox_caption=A paradox?
@ginger_moon_pods_paradox_1_a=But if my past me warned me about the incoming events, who warned him?
@ginger_moon_pods_paradox_2_a=Another me? Who warned that other me? When did it all begin?
@ginger_moon_pods_paradox_3_b=As far as I know, the number of worlds might be infinite.
@ginger_moon_pods_paradox_4_b=It's better to not think about it.

@ginger_moon_pods_loop2_caption=Are we going to remember any of this?
@ginger_moon_pods_loop2_1_a=The computer says something about memory loss.
@ginger_moon_pods_loop2_2_b=Yeah. When your mind ends up in your own body in a different world, this is what happens.
@ginger_moon_pods_loop2_3_b=You merge. Your current memories ... become distant.
@ginger_moon_pods_loop2_4_b=Like a dream that you've forgotten.
@ginger_moon_pods_loop2_5_a=It doesn't sound like we're going to make it in one piece after all...
@ginger_moon_pods_loop2_6_b=It's better than dying completely, I guess.

@ginger_moon_disk1_caption=I've inserted a "Memory Boost" disk.
@ginger_moon_disk2_caption=I've inserted a "Phase Controller Lite" disk.

@ginger_moon_disk_1_a=I've inserted a special disk into the console.
@ginger_moon_disk_2_b=What disk?
@ginger_moon_disk_3_a=A disk I found in the Sidereal Plexus office.
@ginger_moon_disk_4_a=The computer says it will increase the memory transfer, or something like that.
@ginger_moon_disk_5_a=Do you think it's gonna help?
@ginger_moon_disk_6_b=Yeah, I guess so. Even a single helper program like this could make a huge difference...
@ginger_moon_disk_7_b=If our memories are transferred intact...
@ginger_moon_disk_8_b=Or at least in a greater, more consistent rate...
@ginger_moon_disk_9_b=This could be huge, David. This might actually save us.

@ginger_moon_disks_caption=I've inserted a "Memory Boost" and a "Phase Controller Lite" disks.
@ginger_moon_disks_1_a=I've inserted two special disks into the console.
@ginger_moon_disks_2_b=What disks?
@ginger_moon_disks_3_a=One was labelled "Memory Boost" and the other was "Phase Controller Lite".
@ginger_moon_disks_4_a=I found them at the Sidereal Plexus office.
@ginger_moon_disks_5_a=And I know they're gonna help, because I remember using one disk in my previous life.
@ginger_moon_disks_6_b=Wait, what...? You actually remember being here?
@ginger_moon_disks_7_a=Vaguely. Like a dream.
@ginger_moon_disks_8_b=If one disk caused this...
@ginger_moon_disks_9_b=Two of them might actually boost the system enough for us to...
@ginger_moon_disks_10_a=To survive. To end this.
@ginger_moon_disks_11_b=How many loops do you remember?
@ginger_moon_disks_12_a=I'm sure about one. But then again, I had prophetic dreams in that previous life, too, so...
@ginger_moon_disks_13_a=I guess we've been through a lot.
@ginger_moon_disks_14_a=And hopefully this is the last one.
@ginger_moon_disks_15_b=Let's do it, then...

@ginger_moon_radio1_caption=Why sleeper pods have to be on the Moon?
@ginger_moon_radio1_1_a=Why do the sleeper pods have to be on the Moon?
@ginger_moon_radio1_2_a=Why even bother flying here if all they do is put you in a pod?
@ginger_moon_radio1_3_b=Their pods are extremely susceptible to any interference.
@ginger_moon_radio1_4_b=Especially radio waves.
@ginger_moon_radio1_5_b=Humanity used to produce a giant mess of electromagnetic waves of various frequencies.
@ginger_moon_radio1_6_b=Radio broadcasts, TV, communications. I can go on and on.
@ginger_moon_radio1_7_b=Sidereal found it next to impossible to come up with a location desolate enough for their sleeper pods to work as intended.
@ginger_moon_radio1_8_b=Faraday cage shielding was partially effective, but it was apparently causing some side effects.
@ginger_moon_radio1_9_b=Early experiments led to some awful failures.
@ginger_moon_radio1_10_b=They finally came up with the idea that the only thing that would shield the sleeper pods well enough would be...
@ginger_moon_radio1_11_a=The Moon.

@ginger_moon_radio2_caption=Other interferences?
@ginger_moon_radio2_1_a=What about Moon-Earth communication?
@ginger_moon_radio2_2_a=What about radio waves from space?
@ginger_moon_radio2_3_a=Don't they interrupt the sleeper pods?
@ginger_moon_radio2_4_b=Sidereal's own communication devices work on frequencies outside the harmful spectrum.
@ginger_moon_radio2_5_b=Space radiation. Damn it, David. I don't know! They must have found a way around it.
@ginger_moon_radio2_6_b=I'm not a physicist.

@cody_sleep_david_caption=Time to sleep, Cody
@cody_sleep_david_1_a=Cody...
@cody_sleep_david_2_a=It's time.
@cody_sleep_david_2_a=Time to sleep.
@cody_sleep_david_3_b=I don't want to sleep.
@cody_sleep_david_4_a=I know, but we all have to.
@cody_sleep_david_5_b=I won't be able to sleep now. I'm too scared.
@cody_sleep_david_6_a=This machine will help you.
@cody_sleep_david_7_a=Come on.
@cody_sleep_david_8_a=Don't be scared.
@cody_sleep_david_9_b=What will happen?
@cody_sleep_david_10_b=Where will we go?
@cody_sleep_david_11_a=I ... don't know.
@cody_sleep_david_12_a=But it's going to be alright.
@cody_sleep_cate_1_b=Goodnight, Cody.
@cody_sleep_cate_2_a=Goodnight, Cate.
@cody_sleep_barry_1_b=Sleep well, kid.
@cody_sleep_barry_2_a=You too, Barry.
@cody_sleep_2david_1_b=David?
@cody_sleep_2david_2_b=I don't want to be alone again.
@cody_sleep_2david_3_a=You won't be.
@cody_sleep_2david_4_a=Wherever you wake up ... I will find you.
@cody_sleep_2david_5_b=Promise?
@cody_sleep_2david_6_a=Promise.

@barry_sleep_david_caption=It's time to say goodbye.
@barry_sleep_david_1_b=I don't like this idea, David.
@barry_sleep_david_2_b=I know what you want to say, and I don't like it.
@barry_sleep_david_3_a=To be honest, I have no idea if this does anything or if we are just being delusional.
@barry_sleep_david_4_b=Nothing to lose, right?
@barry_sleep_david_5_a=We came this far. Might as well give it a shot.
@barry_sleep_david_6_a=Want me to go first?
@barry_sleep_david_7_b=Nah, it's okay.
@barry_sleep_david_8_b=You seem to be the one who knows which buttons to press.
@barry_sleep_cate_1_a=Hey, Cate.
@barry_sleep_cate_2_a=Maybe I was wrong about you.
@barry_sleep_cate_3_b=I'm ... I'm glad you think so.
@barry_sleep_cate_4_b=I know I can be ... unpleasant.
@barry_sleep_cate_5_a=Yes. But that's just a mask and I can see that.
@barry_sleep_cate_6_a=You're a good person, Cate. Keep it that way.
@barry_sleep_cate_7_a=See you around.
@barry_sleep_cate_8_b=Bye, big man.
@barry_sleep_cody_1_a=Hey, Cody.
@barry_sleep_cody_2_a=Be a good kid and don't stay up late.
@barry_sleep_cody_3_b=Ha ha, Barry.
@barry_sleep_cody_4_a=Seriously, though. Listen to David. And don't be afraid. You're in good hands.
@barry_sleep_cody_5_b=Goodnight, Barry.
@barry_sleep_cody_6_a=Goodnight, kid.
@barry_sleep_2david_1_b=Hey, David?
@barry_sleep_2david_2_a=Yes?
@barry_sleep_2david_3_b=You say we can ... find ourselves anywhere, in any world?
@barry_sleep_2david_4_a=That's how I understand it.
@barry_sleep_2david_5_b=You think...
@barry_sleep_2david_6_b=You think I'll see her?
@barry_sleep_2david_7_b=Maggie.
@barry_sleep_2david_8_b=My wife.
@barry_sleep_2david_9_a=I don't know, Barry.
@barry_sleep_2david_10_a=But I think there's a chance you will.
@barry_sleep_2david_11_a=Say hello to her for me.
@barry_sleep_2david_12_b=Sure thing, David. Sure thing.

@cate_sleep_david_caption=Time to sleep.
@cate_sleep_david_1_a=Time to sleep, right?
@cate_sleep_david_2_a=Or should I go first?
@cate_sleep_david_3_b=It's okay. Remember to turn off the lights.
@cate_sleep_david_4_b=And promise you won't do anything stupid.
@cate_sleep_david_5_a=Have I ever done anything stupid?
@cate_sleep_david_6_b=Hah, you're funny.
@cate_sleep_barry_1_a=Hey, Barry.
@cate_sleep_barry_2_b=Cate?
@cate_sleep_barry_3_a=Sorry if ... I was mean to you.
@cate_sleep_barry_4_b=Oh, it's okay.
@cate_sleep_barry_5_b=That's how you roll, right?
@cate_sleep_barry_6_b=I know you're a good person, Cate. Even if you don't want the world to know.
@cate_sleep_barry_7_b=See you around.
@cate_sleep_barry_8_a=Bye, big man.
@cate_sleep_cody_1_a=Hey, Cody.
@cate_sleep_cody_2_a=Umm...
@cate_sleep_cody_3_a=Never change, okay?
@cate_sleep_cody_4_b=Okay...
@cate_sleep_cody_5_a=See you soon.
@cate_sleep_cody_6_b=Goodnight, Cate...
@cate_sleep_2david_1_b=Alright David, so...
@cate_sleep_2david_2_b=Here we are.
@cate_sleep_2david_3_b=At the end of the road.
@cate_sleep_2david_4_b=Or is it the beginning?
@cate_sleep_2david_5_b=I wouldn't have made it here if it wasn't for you.
@cate_sleep_2david_6_a=Are you getting emotional now?
@cate_sleep_2david_7_b=Hah. I think I've spent too much time with you.
@cate_sleep_2david_8_a=Where do you hope to wake up?
@cate_sleep_2david_9_b=In a bed. In a world where they have a Moon and lattes.
@cate_sleep_2david_10_a=I hope that's what happens.
@cate_sleep_2david_11_b=Me too.
@cate_sleep_2david_12_b=Bye, David. Until we meet again.
@cate_sleep_2david_13_a=Just don't point your gun at me when we do, okay?
@cate_sleep_2david_14_b=Can't promise that.

@ginger_give_pills_1_a=Hey, so, before I forget...
@ginger_give_pills_2_a=Here. Take one right before we lift off.
@ginger_give_pills_3_b=Hah.
@ginger_give_pills_4_a=What?
@ginger_give_pills_5_b="Take one before we lift off." You sound like a drug dealer using some weird slang.
@ginger_give_pills_6_a=Hah.

@ginger_gave_pills_1_b=Hey, it's the drug dealer again.
@ginger_gave_pills_2_b=I already have a pill from your stash.

@cody_give_pills_1_a=Hey, Cody. Here, take this.
@cody_give_pills_2_b=What's that?
@cody_give_pills_3_a=Medicine.
@cody_give_pills_4_b=I'm not feeling sick.
@cody_give_pills_5_a=I know, but this will help you breathe in the spaceship.
@cody_give_pills_6_b=Will I be able to breathe in space?!
@cody_give_pills_7_a=No, not really...
@cody_give_pills_8_a=Just keep this pill and swallow it right before we launch.
@cody_give_pills_9_b=Okay...

@cody_gave_pills_1_a=Cody, please remind me. Did I already give you the pills?
@cody_gave_pills_2_b=Yes, you did.
@cody_gave_pills_3_a=Thanks.

@barry_give_pills_1_a=I created special pills.
@barry_give_pills_2_b=Let me guess, you want me to take one.
@barry_give_pills_3_a=Yes.
@barry_give_pills_4_b=Normally if someone would tell me to take a pill that's going to help me get to the Moon...
@barry_give_pills_5_a=Yeah, I know. Just make sure to swallow it right before we launch, okay?
@barry_give_pills_6_b=Sure thing.

@barry_gave_pills_1_a=Hey, did I...?
@barry_gave_pills_2_b=Yes. I already have a pill.

@cate_emial_1_a=Huh...?
@cate_emial_2_a=Catherine Mayweather...
@cate_emial_3_a=Pilot.
@cate_emial_4_a=Could that be Cate?
@cate_emial_5_a=We really need to have a talk.

@lodge_roof_1_a=Solar panels...?
@lodge_roof_2_b=Yeah. That's probably how they kept the lights on at night.
@lodge_roof_3_a=Solar panels don't work at night...
@lodge_roof_4_b=Come on, David. Don't be stupid. They store the power during the day.
@lodge_roof_5_a=Hey, I knew that. I was just joking.
@lodge_roof_6_b=Anyway, I can barely see those panels under all those dead leaves.
@lodge_roof_7_b=I doubt they collect anything.
@lodge_roof_8_a=Well, I could climb the roof using the porch railing, but I need something to help me remove those leaves.
@lodge_roof_cody_1_c=Can I climb it, too?

@soliders_intro1_1_b=Hold it!
@soliders_intro1_2_a=Wha ... who are you?!
@soliders_intro1_3_c=Hands in the air! Now!

@soliders_intro2_1_c=Relax guys, we're just...
@soliders_intro2_2_b=HANDS. IN. THE. AIR. NOW!
@soliders_intro2_3_a=Alright, alright ... There, okay?
@soliders_intro2_4_a=Cate, would you...?
@soliders_intro2_5_c=...

@soliders_intro1_cody_1_c=Please don't shoot us! We're innocent!
@soliders_intro1_cody_2_a=It's okay, Cody. They're not going to shoot us.

@soliders_intro1_barry_1_c=You're soldiers. You wear uniforms. Where's your decency?
@soliders_intro1_barry_2_c=Ambushing peaceful travelers like a bunch of thugs...
@soliders_intro1_barry_3_b=Sir, you're not being ambushed. We're just holding guard here.

@soliders_intro3_1_c=Who are you?
@soliders_intro3_2_a=My name is David. This is Cate. And...
@soliders_intro3_3_b=Alright, save it.
@soliders_intro3_4_b=You can explain everything to the Sarge.

@sarge_whiskey_1_b=I don't drink ... not on duty, at least.
@sarge_whiskey_2_b=I know some guys at the camp who would love to get smashed, though.
@sarge_whiskey_3_b=Anyway, just take this away.

@r_sarge_intro1_1_c=Alright, let's keep it civilized.
@r_sarge_intro1_2_a=I'm very much in favor of that.
@r_sarge_intro1_3_c=Let's start with this. Who are you and what are you doing here?

@r_sarge_hello1_caption=Just travelers.
@r_sarge_hello1_1_a=We're just travelers. We're looking for supplies.
@r_sarge_hello1_2_c=So you're looters.
@r_sarge_hello1_3_a=That's a harsh word. We're just trying to survive.
@r_sarge_hello1_4_a=My name is David. This is Cate.

@r_sarge_hello2_caption=None of your business.
@r_sarge_hello2_1_a=It's none of your business who we are.
@r_sarge_hello2_2_c=That's where you're wrong, son.
@r_sarge_hello2_3_c=You snuck into my camp, and your life is now in my hands.
@r_sarge_hello2_4_c=I'd choose your words more carefully if I were you.
@r_sarge_hello2_5_c=But fine. Let's have it your way. May I have your names at least?
@r_sarge_hello2_6_a=Look. We were just looking for supplies, okay? Name's David.
@r_sarge_hello2_7_b=Cate.

@r_sarge_hello3_caption=We're a family.
@r_sarge_hello3_1_a=We're just looking for supplies.
@r_sarge_hello3_2_a=My name is David. This is my wife, Cate.
@r_sarge_hello3_3_b=David...?
@r_sarge_hello3_4_a=Relax, dear. I got this.
@r_sarge_hello3_5_b=Sure.
@r_sarge_hello3_6_b=Dear.
@r_sarge_hello3_7_a=Ahem.
@r_sarge_hello3_8_a=So, as I was saying. That's us.

@r_sarge_hello3_cody_1_a=That's our son Cody.
@r_sarge_hello3_cody_2_c=Um. Yes. Hello.

@r_sarge_hello3_barry_1_a=And that's Barry, our, err, our...
@r_sarge_hello3_barry_2_c=I'm Cate's stepfather.
@r_sarge_hello3_barry_3_b=*sigh*

@r_sarge_hello1_cody_1_a=That's Cody.
@r_sarge_hello1_cody_2_c=Hello.

@r_sarge_hello1_barry_1_a=And that's Barry.
@r_sarge_hello1_barry_2_c=Mhm.

@r_sarge_intro2_1_c=And you're just looking for supplies.
@r_sarge_intro2_2_a=Yes. Can I ask you the same question?
@r_sarge_intro2_3_c=Sergeant First Class Franklin McWillis.
@r_sarge_intro2_4_c=And this is my squad.
@r_sarge_intro2_5_c=Josh, Mark, Steve and Paul.
@r_sarge_intro2_6_a=So ... you're with the army?
@r_sarge_intro2_7_c=We ARE the army. All that's left of it, it would appear.
@r_sarge_intro2_8_c=There is no more government. No more HQ. We're on our own.
@r_sarge_intro2_9_a=You're still wearing uniforms, though.
@r_sarge_intro2_10_c=That's what keeps us together, son.
@r_sarge_intro2_11_a=What are you going to do with us now?
@r_sarge_intro2_12_c=Nothing. At ease, guys. Back to your posts.

@r_sarge_intro3_1_c=Alright.
@r_sarge_intro3_2_c=Sorry about that. You never know these days.
@r_sarge_intro3_3_c=It's good to meet a friendly face for once.

@r_sarge_wounded1_caption=You've got a wounded person.
@r_sarge_wounded1_1_a=What happened to him?
@r_sarge_wounded1_2_c=Who, Steve?
@r_sarge_wounded1_3_c=We were attacked. A small group of bandits. Nothing we couldn't handle.
@r_sarge_wounded1_4_c=But Steve was wounded and is not doing well.
@r_sarge_wounded1_5_c=We don't have anything to treat him with.
@r_sarge_wounded1_6_c=I was hoping we'd find something here, but no luck.
@r_sarge_wounded1_7_a=What do you need exactly?

@r_sarge_wounded6_caption=How is Steve doing?
@r_sarge_wounded6_1_a=How is Steve doing?
@r_sarge_wounded6_2_c=We still don't have everything to treat his wounds.
@r_sarge_wounded6_3_a=What do you need exactly?

@r_sarge_wounded5_caption=How is Steve doing?
@r_sarge_wounded5_1_a=How is Steve doing?
@r_sarge_wounded5_2_c=Thanks to your help he should be fine.
@r_sarge_wounded5_3_c=You've got my gratitude.
@r_sarge_wounded5_4_b=Wow, thanks. I'll put your gratitude in a frame on my wall.
@r_sarge_wounded5_5_c=...I'll also instruct Paul to help you with resources if you need anything.

@r_sarge_wounded2_1_c=Some bandages.
@r_sarge_wounded2_2_c=And something to disinfect his wounds.

@r_sarge_wounded3_1_c=We disinfected his wounds.
@r_sarge_wounded3_2_c=But he still needs fresh bandages.

@r_sarge_wounded8_1_c=Wait, you brought bandages and alcohol already?
@r_sarge_wounded8_2_c=That's very thoughtful of you. How did you know?
@r_sarge_wounded8_3_a=Call it a hunch.
@r_sarge_wounded8_4_a=Or a memory of a dream.
@r_sarge_wounded8_5_c=Huh? Okay, whatever.

@r_sarge_wounded4_1_c=We have fresh bandages...
@r_sarge_wounded4_2_c=But he still needs his wounds to be disinfected.

@r_sarge_plans1_caption=Where will you go?
@r_sarge_plans1_1_a=So what's your plan, Sarge?
@r_sarge_plans1_2_c=We're headed west. This is our final stop before we attempt to take on the desert that lies beyond this place.
@r_sarge_plans1_3_c=I guess you're traveling in the same direction? You could join us if you want.

@r_sarge_plans2_caption=We're going east.
@r_sarge_plans2_1_a=Actually, we're going east.
@r_sarge_plans2_2_c=East? That's a terrible idea.
@r_sarge_plans2_3_a=Why?
@r_sarge_plans2_4_c=We just came from there, escaping a dreadful storm.
@r_sarge_plans2_5_c=It's hell, I'm telling you. Thunderstorms like you've never seen before.
@r_sarge_plans2_6_c=The rain is acidic. It burns skin.
@r_sarge_plans2_7_c=Trust me, you don't want to go east. Not today at least.

@r_sarge_plans3_caption=Come with us.
@r_sarge_plans3_1_a=Don't you want to come with us?
@r_sarge_plans3_2_b=David ... a word please?
@r_sarge_plans3_3_a=What is it, Cate?
@r_sarge_plans3_4_b=We can't just offer a ride to everyone we meet.
@r_sarge_plans3_cody_barry=Cody and Barry ... I get it, they're with us.
@r_sarge_plans3_cody=Cody, I get it, he's with us.
@r_sarge_plans3_barry=Barry, I get it, he's with us.

@r_sarge_plans3_company=But we can't take more hitchhikers.
@r_sarge_plans3_single=We can't start taking hitchhikers now.

@r_sarge_plans4_1_b=We don't know what condition the ship is in. How much fuel there will be. How much air reserves. There might be a strict weight limit.
@r_sarge_plans4_2_c=It's okay.
@r_sarge_plans4_3_a=Hm?
@r_sarge_plans4_4_c=I wouldn't want to go anyway.
@r_sarge_plans4_5_a=But ... the world is doomed.
@r_sarge_plans4_6_c=I've come to terms with that.
@r_sarge_plans4_7_a=And your men? They have the right to decide for themselves, right?
@r_sarge_plans4_8_c=Right. But we're a team. A squad that keeps together, no matter what.
@r_sarge_plans4_9_c=Why don't you ask them yourself?
@r_sarge_plans4_10_a=Right now I'm asking you.
@r_sarge_plans4_11_c=Okay. So here's my answer.
@r_sarge_plans4_12_c=Good luck with your plan. I mean it.
@r_sarge_plans4_13_c=But we're staying.

@r_sarge_places_caption=Do you know any interesting places?
@r_sarge_places1_1_a=Have you seen any interesting places worth exploring?
@r_sarge_places1_2_a=We're looking for things to fortify our hideout.
@r_sarge_places1_3_c=Hm. There's a construction site south of here.
@r_sarge_places1_4_c=My boys saw it when they scouted the area, but we're not sure what's there.
@r_sarge_places1_5_c=Maybe you'll find something useful there.
@r_sarge_places1_6_c=Here, let me mark it on your map...

@r_sarge_survive1_caption=How can we survive this storm?
@r_sarge_survive1_1_a=Do you have any ideas on how we can survive the storm?
@r_sarge_survive1_2_c=Damn it, son! Why are you so stubborn?
@r_sarge_survive1_3_c=If you have to stay, dig some ditches around your hideout to lead the water away.
@r_sarge_survive1_4_c=Also, maybe talk to Paul. He's our technician, and I know he has some scientific instruments that might help you.
@r_sarge_survive1_5_c=But don't expect our help for nothing in return. We have our own needs.

@r_sarge_catchers1_caption=Help us install the Storm Catcher.
@r_sarge_catchers1_1_a=Paul gave me those ... Storm Catcher things.
@r_sarge_catchers1_2_c=Ah, yes. He told me about those.
@r_sarge_catchers1_3_a=Yeah. So, I'm supposed to install them somewhere high above ground.
@r_sarge_catchers1_4_a=Form a triangle around our base.
@r_sarge_catchers1_5_c=Sounds like a plan to me, if Paul says it'll work.
@r_sarge_catchers1_6_a=This restaurant's pylon sign isn't very high, but it's surrounded by mostly empty space. It should be sufficient, according to Paul.
@r_sarge_catchers1_7_a=Could you help us get it up there? We don't have a ladder or anything like that.
@r_sarge_catchers1_8_c=Hm. How about we trade?
@r_sarge_catchers1_9_a=What do you have in mind?
@r_sarge_catchers1_10_c=We're low on ammo, and our guns are in critical condition.
@r_sarge_catchers1_11_c=Bring me a firearm and some bullets, and I can order my men to install this thing for you up there.
@r_sarge_catchers1_12_c=Do we have a deal?
@r_sarge_catchers1_13_a=I guess we do.

@r_sarge_catchers2_caption=What was the deal again?
@r_sarge_catchers2_1_a=What was the deal again?
@r_sarge_catchers2_2_c=Bring me a firearm, preferably something compact, and some spare ammo for it.
@r_sarge_catchers2_3_c=Then give me the Storm Catcher, and we'll put it on top of the restaurant's pylon sign.

@r_sarge_catchers3_caption=Our deal...
@r_sarge_catchers3_1_a=So what's with our deal?
@r_sarge_catchers3_2_c=You've done your part.
@r_sarge_catchers3_3_c=Just give me the Storm Catcher, and we'll put it on top of the restaurant's pylon sign.

@r_sarge_catchers4_1_c=Okay. I'll tell my boys to put that on the pylon for you.
@r_sarge_catchers4_2_c=We'll also power the pylon so the Storm Catcher actually works.
@r_sarge_catchers4_3_a=Thanks, Sarge.
@r_sarge_catchers4_4_c=No problem. But remember ... you still have to install two more Catchers to form a triangle around your base.

@r_sarge_catchers_gun1_1_c=This revolver should do.
@r_sarge_catchers_gun1_2_c=It's in perfect condition. Where did you find it?
@r_sarge_catchers_gun1_3_a=I have my sources.

@r_sarge_catchers_gun2_1_a=I'd rather not give them this gun. I might need it later. I should find them something else.
@r_sarge_catchers_gun3_1_a=I already gave them everything they wanted.

@r_sarge_catchers_ammo1_1_c=This ammo will do.
@r_sarge_catchers_ammo2_1_c=I don't want to be fussy, but I'd rather take ammo that fits the gun you brought.
@r_sarge_catchers_ammo3_1_c=Hmm, you know what? How about you bring that gun first and I'll see if that ammo is the right type.

@r_sarge_catchers_deal0_1_a=I should make some sort of deal before I start handing them my stuff.

@r_sarge_catchers5_1_a=I've already given him one Catcher. I should install two more somewhere myself to form a triangle around the base.

@r_sarge_bye_caption=Goodbye
@r_sarge_first_bye_1_a=So ... you're letting us go?
@r_sarge_first_bye_2_b=Yeah. You're not the bandits we mistook you for.
@r_sarge_first_bye_3_b=Sorry if we scared you.
@r_sarge_first_bye_4_b=We'll head off soon after the sunset. Until then, if you need anything, just ask.
@r_sarge_first_bye_5_a=Okay...

@r_sarge_bye_1_a=I should go.
@r_sarge_bye_2_b=Good luck!

@r_paul_intro1_1_a=Hi.
@r_paul_intro1_2_b=David, eh? I'm Paul.
@r_paul_intro1_3_b=I'm the team's main engineer.
@r_paul_intro1_4_c=Engineer, huh?
@r_paul_intro1_5_a=Nice to meet you.
@r_paul_intro1_6_b=Is there anything you need?

@r_paul_intro2_b=Is there anything you need?

@r_paul_catchers1_caption=We want to survive that storm.
@r_paul_catchers1_1_a=We want to survive that storm.
@r_paul_catchers1_2_b=Why don't you just come with us and avoid the whole thing?
@r_paul_catchers1_3_a=There's no time. Escaping the storm means we lose too much of tomorrow to travel back.
@r_paul_catchers1_4_b=If I were you I'd make sure the house you're staying at has a lightning rod on the roof.
@r_paul_catchers1_5_b=And if it doesn't, I'd make one.

@r_paul_catchers2_caption=Do you have anything that might help with the thunderstorm?
@r_paul_catchers2_1_a=Do you have anything that might help with the thunderstorm?
@r_paul_catchers2_2_b=Well, I have something...
@r_paul_catchers2_3_b=They're called Storm Catchers. Experimental devices created by...
@r_paul_catchers2_4_a=Sidereal Plexus?
@r_paul_catchers2_5_b=How did you know?
@r_paul_catchers2_6_c=Lucky guess.
@r_paul_catchers2_7_b=Anyway, this technology actually repels thunderstorms.
@r_paul_catchers2_8_a=Can we have them?

@r_paul_catchers3_1_b=Well ... I'm not sure.
@r_paul_catchers3_2_a=Come on, you're not staying here for the storm, right? So you don't really need them.
@r_paul_catchers3_3_b=Yeah, but why should you have them?
@r_paul_catchers3_4_c=Because we want them?
@r_paul_catchers3_5_b=You know what? Prove me you actually deserve our help.
@r_paul_catchers3_6_c=David, why don't we just...
@r_paul_catchers3_7_a=Calm down, Cate. Please. We'll think of something.

@r_paul_catchers4_caption=Storm Catchers
@r_paul_catchers4_1_a=What's with those Storm Catchers?

@r_paul_catchers5_1_b=I still don't know if I should bother helping you.
@r_paul_catchers5_2_b=Prove you're worth the effort first.

@r_paul_catchers6_1_b=Well since you helped Steve, I feel obligated to help you in return.
@r_paul_catchers6_2_b=So here they are.

@r_paul_catchers7_caption=How do you use those Storm catchers?
@r_paul_catchers7_1_a=How do you use those?
@r_paul_catchers7_2_b=Okay, so there are three Catchers in the set.
@r_paul_catchers7_3_b=Each of them has to be mounted on a high spot. The higher, the better.
@r_paul_catchers7_4_b=Also, each of them needs electricity to function.
@r_paul_catchers7_5_b=In order to make them work, you have to place them all within a few miles of each other.
@r_paul_catchers7_6_b=Try forming a triangle around your hideout.

@r_paul_mount1_caption=Restaurant pylon
@r_paul_mount1_1_a=Would putting a Storm Cather on the hamburger pylon outside this restaurant work?
@r_paul_mount1_2_b=It's not very high, but with nothing else but desert around, I guess it would be fine.
@r_paul_mount1_3_b=There should also be electric cables there. You'll just need to power it.
@r_paul_mount1_4_b=I guess it's a good spot.
@r_paul_mount1_5_a=Can you help us put a Storm Catcher there?
@r_paul_mount1_6_b=Uh, I don't know. Ask Sarge if that's possible.

@r_paul_mount2_caption=Restaurant pylon
@r_paul_mount2_1_a=Sarge said it's okay for you to help us with the pylon.
@r_paul_mount2_2_b=Awesome. Just hand the Catcher to Sarge then.

@r_paul_come1_caption=Do you want to come with us?
@r_paul_come1_1_a=Do you want to come with us?
@r_paul_come1_2_b=Negative.
@r_paul_come1_3_c=We could use your technical knowledge, Paul.
@r_paul_come1_4_b=Can you take all of us with you?
@r_paul_come1_5_a=Uh ... probably not.
@r_paul_come1_6_b=Then, as I said. Negative. We're a team.
@r_paul_come1_7_c=How remarkably noble.
@r_paul_come1_8_c=...and stupid.

@r_paul_bye1_1_a=Bye.
@r_paul_bye1_2_b=See ya.

@r_steve_intro1_1_b=Uhhh...
@r_steve_intro1_2_b=What do you want?
@r_steve_intro1_3_c=Are you always this friendly?
@r_steve_intro1_4_b=Only with bullet holes, ma'am.

@r_steve_intro2_1_b=Yeah...?
@=
@r_steve_come1_caption=Do you want to come with us?
@r_steve_come1_1_a=Do you want to come with us?
@r_steve_come1_2_b=Are you willing to carry me?
@r_steve_come1_3_b=*cough*
@r_steve_come1_4_c=I'm done.
@r_steve_come1_5_a=Okay. Fair enough.
@r_steve_you1_caption=How do you feel?
@r_steve_you1_1_a=How do you feel?
@r_steve_you1_2_b=How do you think I feel?
@r_steve_you1_3_b=Like a kitchen strainer.
@r_steve_you1_4_b=*cough*
@r_steve_you1_5_a=Is there anything we can do to help?
@r_steve_you2_1_b=If you have a clean bandage and something to disinfect the wounds, that'd be great.
@r_steve_you3_1_b=If you have something to disinfect the wounds, that'd be great.
@r_steve_you4_1_b=If you have a clean bandage, that'd be great.

@r_steve_you5_1_a=How do you feel now?
@r_steve_you5_2_b=Better.
@r_steve_you5_3_b=Thanks. I owe ya.
@r_steve_you5_4_b=*cough*

@r_steve_give_bandage_1_a=This bandage should help...
@r_steve_give_bandage_2_b=Yeah ... thanks.

@r_steve_give_alcohol_1_a=I guess this could be used to disinfect the wound...
@r_steve_give_alcohol_2_b=Whoa, wait. That'd be a waste of fine whiskey.
@r_steve_give_alcohol_3_a=Oh, come on. You can have the rest of it.

@r_steve_healed1_1_c=That's it - we can now properly mend your wounds, Steve.
@r_steve_healed1_2_c=Can you help, Cate?
@r_steve_healed1_3_b=Why, because I'm a girl it automatically means I'm a nurse?
@r_steve_healed1_4_a=It's okay. I'll do it.

@r_steve_bye_1_1_a=Bye.

@r_mark_intro1_1_a=Hi.
@r_mark_intro1_2_b=Can't talk. I'm on guard duty.
@r_mark_intro1_3_a=I'll make it quick...

@r_mark_sarge1_caption=What do you think about Sarge?
@r_mark_sarge1_1_a=What do you think about Sarge?
@r_mark_sarge1_2_c=Good leader.
@r_mark_sarge1_3_c=Honorable man.
@r_mark_sarge1_4_c=Trusted friend.

@r_mark_come1_caption=Do you want to come with us?
@r_mark_come1_1_a=Do you want to come with us?
@r_mark_come1_2_c=Why would I?
@r_mark_come1_3_a=We ... might have a way out of this mess.
@r_mark_come1_4_c=You're one of those crazy sect people, right?
@r_mark_come1_5_c=Aliens will come and help you ascend...
@r_mark_come1_6_c=...you only have to commit mass suicide on top of a hill.
@r_mark_come1_7_c=Am I right?
@r_mark_come1_8_a=No, no, no. Nothing like that.
@r_mark_come1_9_a=We'll find a spaceship and...
@r_mark_come1_10_c=I knew it.
@r_mark_come1_11_c=Crazy sect people...
@r_mark_come1_12_b=*clap*
@r_mark_come1_13_b=*clap*
@r_mark_come1_14_b=*clap*

@r_mark_bye1_1_a=I should go.
@r_josh_bye1_1_a=Carry on, soldier.

@r_josh_intro1_1_a=Hi.
@r_josh_intro1_2_b=Hm? What do you want?

@r_josh_sarge1_caption=What do you think about Sarge?
@r_josh_sarge1_1_a=What do you think about Sarge?
@r_josh_sarge1_2_c=He's okay.
@r_josh_sarge1_3_c=Wait, did he send you to ask me?
@r_josh_sarge1_4_a=No...
@r_josh_sarge1_5_c=Then why do you want to know?
@r_josh_sarge1_6_a=Just curious, I guess.

@r_josh_come1_caption=Do you want to come with us?
@r_josh_come1_1_a=Do you want to come with us?
@r_josh_come1_2_c=Where?
@r_josh_come1_3_a=We ... might have a way out of this mess.
@r_josh_come1_4_c=Great.
@r_josh_come1_5_c=Have you discussed it with Sarge?
@r_josh_come1_6_a=Well ... I'm discussing it with you.
@r_josh_come1_7_c=I'm not a deserter. And I don't want becoming one to be the last thing I do.

@r_sarge_medical=I'd better give any medical supplies directly to the wounded guy.

@day2_overslept_1_a=As you struggled to recover from your wounds you were woken up by the tremendous crash...
@day2_overslept_2_a=You barely registered it, as your heavy eyelids closed again...

@dream_tiger_intro_1_b=Meow.
@dream_tiger_intro_2_b=Hi. Meow.
@dream_tiger_intro_3_a=Um ... hi?
@dream_tiger_intro_4_a=You can speak?
@dream_tiger_intro_5_b=Of course I can. Meow. What did you expect?
@dream_tiger_intro_6_b=It's just a dream. Meow.
@dream_tiger_intro_7_a=Oh. Right.
@dream_tiger_intro_8_a=I forgot.
@dream_tiger_intro_9_b=You forget quite a lot of things every time you're here.

@dream_tiger_remember_caption=I forget things?
@dream_tiger_remember_1_a=What do you mean I forget quite a lot of things?
@dream_tiger_remember_2_b=Exactly that. Meow!
@dream_tiger_remember_3_b=Your head is, err, not good at holding all those memories from previous times.
@dream_tiger_remember_4_a=Wait, what?
@dream_tiger_remember_5_b=Meow, meow.
@dream_tiger_remember_6_b=Just try to remember this time, okay?
@dream_tiger_remember_7_b=Focus, meow!

@dream_tiger_who_caption=Who are you?
@dream_tiger_who_1_a=Excuse me ... who are you?
@dream_tiger_who_2_b=Meow.
@dream_tiger_who_3_b=I'm Cody's plushie tiger.
@dream_tiger_who_4_a=Cody's ... plushie tiger?
@dream_tiger_who_5_b=Yes, meow.
@dream_tiger_who_6_b=Actually, I'm more like an echo of Cody's memory of me.
@dream_tiger_who_7_a=An echo of his memory...?
@dream_tiger_who_8_b=That sounds terribly weird, I know.
@dream_tiger_who_9_b=Meow.

@dream_tiger_cody_caption=About Cody...
@dream_tiger_cody_1_a=So, you're a memory of Cody's tiger.
@dream_tiger_cody_2_b=Meow.
@dream_tiger_cody_3_a=That somehow ended up in my dream.
@dream_tiger_cody_4_b=Meow, meow.
@dream_tiger_cody_5_b=Because you carry a great burden in your heart.
@dream_tiger_cody_6_b=Because you let Cody die.
@dream_tiger_cody_7_a=No, wait. What are you talking about? Cody is fine!
@dream_tiger_cody_8_a=He survived the night!
@dream_tiger_cody_9_b=He might have survived the night, meow.
@dream_tiger_cody_10_b=But he didn't survive your last lifetime.
@dream_tiger_cody_11_a=What does that even mean?
@dream_tiger_cody_12_b=You know. Deep inside, you know.
@dream_tiger_cody_13_b=Save him, David.
@dream_tiger_cody_14_b=Don't let him die again.

@dream_tiger_future_caption=Tell me the future.
@dream_tiger_future_1_a=What's gonna happen?
@dream_tiger_future_2_a=Can you tell me?
@dream_tiger_future_3_b=You want to save all your friends.
@dream_tiger_future_4_b=Sometimes it is impossible.
@dream_tiger_future_5_b=Not this time, though.
@dream_tiger_future_6_b=Tell him to stay.
@dream_tiger_future_7_a=Huh?
@dream_tiger_future_8_b=When you arrive at the sand tomb. Tell him to wait for you.
@dream_tiger_future_9_a=And ... that's it?
@dream_tiger_future_10_b=Sometimes one less is one more.
@dream_tiger_future_11_b=Meow.
@dream_tiger_future_12_b=I think we have company.
@dream_tiger_future_13_a=Who ... what's that?!
@dream_tiger_future_14_b=Run, David. Run fast.
@dream_tiger_future_15_b=And remember to tell Cody to wait for you.

@dream_maggie_intro_1_b=Hello, dear.
@dream_maggie_intro_2_a=W-what, wait, you're...
@dream_maggie_intro_3_a=I must be dreaming.
@dream_maggie_intro_4_b=Indeed you are, my dear.

@dream_maggie_who_caption=Who are you?
@dream_maggie_who_1_a=I know you...
@dream_maggie_who_2_a=I ... buried you ... 
@dream_maggie_who_3_a=You're Barry's wife.
@dream_maggie_who_4_b=Yes you did bury me, honey.
@dream_maggie_who_5_b=I'm quite grateful for that.
@dream_maggie_who_6_a=Um, no problem.

@dream_maggie_remember_caption=Dream?
@dream_maggie_remember_1_a=It's a dream...?
@dream_maggie_remember_2_b=Yes, darling.
@dream_maggie_remember_3_b=It's quite obvious once you look around and think for a second.
@dream_maggie_remember_4_b=You've been here before, but your memory is failing you.
@dream_maggie_remember_5_b=It's from dream-travelling.
@dream_maggie_remember_6_b=You've gotta watch out as you do it.
@dream_maggie_remember_7_b=It can lead to dementia.
@dream_maggie_remember_8_a=I don't understand...
@dream_maggie_remember_9_b=I hope you will, because a lot depends on it.

@dream_maggie_barry_caption=About Barry...
@dream_maggie_barry_1_a=Barry is your husband.
@dream_maggie_barry_2_b=Yes, darling.
@dream_maggie_barry_3_a=And for some reason you're in my dream.
@dream_maggie_barry_4_b=Well, not personally.
@dream_maggie_barry_5_b=I'm dead, remember?
@dream_maggie_barry_6_b=I'm just an echo of Barry's memory of me.
@dream_maggie_barry_7_a=W-why are you here?
@dream_maggie_barry_8_b=I'm here because you let Barry die, honey.
@dream_maggie_barry_9_a=What? No.
@dream_maggie_barry_10_a=That's impossible. He is fine.
@dream_maggie_barry_11_b=Oh maybe now he is fine.
@dream_maggie_barry_12_b=But he didn't survive your previous life.
@dream_maggie_barry_13_a=Previous life...?
@dream_maggie_barry_14_b=You've been here before.
@dream_maggie_barry_15_b=Deep inside you know it's true.

@dream_maggie_future_caption=Tell me the future.
@dream_maggie_future_1_a=What's gonna happen?
@dream_maggie_future_2_a=Can you tell me?
@dream_maggie_future_3_b=You care for your friends, darling.
@dream_maggie_future_4_b=You're a good man.
@dream_maggie_future_5_b=And I don't want that boy to get hurt either!
@dream_maggie_future_6_b=But if you try, you could save my husband, too.
@dream_maggie_future_7_b=Just don't let him go there.
@dream_maggie_future_8_a=Go where?
@dream_maggie_future_9_b=The sand tomb. Don't let him go there. Tell him to wait.
@dream_maggie_future_10_b=Oh, dear.
@dream_maggie_future_11_b=I think our time here has run out. They've found you.
@dream_maggie_future_12_a=Who ... what is that?!
@dream_maggie_future_13_b=Run, David. Don't let this thing touch you.
@dream_maggie_future_14_b=And please warn Barry.
@dream_maggie_future_15_b=Also, tell him I love him.
@dream_maggie_future_16_b=And that it wasn't his fault.

@dream_maggie_tiger_intro_1_c=Hello, honey.
@dream_maggie_tiger_intro_2_b=Meow!
@dream_maggie_tiger_intro_3_c=What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost.
@dream_maggie_tiger_intro_4_b=Or a talking tiger, tee-hee.

@dream_maggie_tiger_future_caption=Tell me the future.
@dream_maggie_tiger_future_1_a=What's gonna happen?
@dream_maggie_tiger_future_2_a=Can you tell me?
@dream_maggie_tiger_future_3_b=You know very well.
@dream_maggie_tiger_future_4_c=Yeah, you've gotta remember by now!
@dream_maggie_tiger_future_5_a=Sidereal Plexus ... the fall ... 
@dream_maggie_tiger_future_6_c=That's it!
@dream_maggie_tiger_future_7_b=You just have to stop Barry from going with you.
@dream_maggie_tiger_future_8_c=Or Cody.
@dream_maggie_tiger_future_9_b=Either way, you know what to do.
@dream_maggie_tiger_future_10_b=You've done this before.
@dream_maggie_tiger_future_11_c=You also know HE is going to be right behind you now.
@dream_maggie_tiger_future_12_a=Yeah ... what is that thing anyway?
@dream_maggie_tiger_future_13_b=Night folk.
@dream_maggie_tiger_future_14_c=One of the Shadow people.
@dream_maggie_tiger_future_15_b=Run, David. Run.
@dream_maggie_tiger_future_16_c=Meow!

@cody_warn_caption=Stay behind and wait for us.
@cody_warn_1_a=Uh, Cody?
@cody_warn_2_b=Yes?
@cody_warn_3_a=When we travel to Sidereal Plexus, could you stay and wait for us?
@cody_warn_variant1a=Could you wait for us by the road?
@cody_warn_variant1b=Could you wait for us by the car?
@cody_warn_4_b=Why...?
@cody_warn_5_b=Are you gonna leave me behind...?
@cody_warn_6_a=No. Absolutely not.
@cody_warn_7_a=I just ... have a bad feeling.
@cody_warn_8_a=Can you trust me on that?
@cody_warn_9_a=Just don't go with us this one time.
@cody_warn_10_b=Okay ... I trust you, David.
@cody_warn_11_b=When we get there, I'll just stay behind and wait.
@cody_warn_variant2a=I'll just wait by the road.
@cody_warn_variant2b=I'll just wait by the car.
@cody_warn_12_a=Thanks, Cody.
@cody_warn_13_a=Don't worry. I'll be back for you.

@barry_warn_caption=Stay behind and wait for us.
@barry_warn_1_a=Hey, Barry.
@barry_warn_2_b=Yes?
@barry_warn_3_a=When we travel to Sidereal Plexus, could you stay and wait for us?
@barry_warn_variant1a=Could you wait for us by the road?
@barry_warn_variant1b=Could you wait for us by the car?
@barry_warn_4_b=Why...?
@barry_warn_5_b=Don't you think it's dangerous to separate like this?
@barry_warn_6_a=Yeah, usually it is.
@barry_warn_7_a=I just ... have a bad feeling about this one.
@barry_warn_8_a=Can you trust me on that?
@barry_warn_9_a=Just wait for us.
@barry_warn_10_b=I have no idea why you're doing this, but okay.
@barry_warn_11_b=When we get there, I'll just stay behind and wait.
@barry_warn_variant2a=I'll just wait by the road.
@barry_warn_variant2b=I'll just wait by the car.
@barry_warn_12_a=Thanks, Barry.
@barry_warn_13_b=No problem. Just be careful out there, okay?

@barry_wife_caption=Your wife loved you.
@barry_wife_1_a=Maggie loved you.
@barry_wife_2_b=Huh?
@barry_wife_3_b=Of course she did! And I loved her.
@barry_wife_4_b=But why on Earth would you bring that up now?
@barry_wife_5_a=Just ... I don't know.
@barry_wife_6_a=I...
@barry_wife_7_a=I don't think she blames you for anything that happened.
@barry_wife_8_b=I don't want to talk about it, David.
@barry_wife_9_b=We have things to do.

@cody_tiger_caption=Did you have a toy tiger?
@cody_tiger_1_a=Cody, did you at any point have a...
@cody_tiger_2_a=Well, a stuffed toy tiger?
@cody_tiger_3_b=Yes!
@cody_tiger_4_b=No. I mean, no.
@cody_tiger_5_b=Plushies are for small kids.
@cody_tiger_6_b=I'm not a small kid.
@cody_tiger_7_b=...
@cody_tiger_8_b=I had a plush tiger when I was younger.
@cody_tiger_9_b=I lost it, though.
@cody_tiger_10_b=How did you know? And why do you ask?
@cody_tiger_11_a=I don't know. Just a lucky guess.
@cody_tiger_12_b=You ... didn't happen to find a plush tiger, did you?
@cody_tiger_13_a=Umm ... no. I did not.
@cody_tiger_14_b=Okay.
@cody_tiger_15_b=I miss him.

@cate_restaurant_leaflet_1_a=Cate, could this have something to do with the outpost you're looking for?
@cate_restaurant_leaflet_2_a=Because it says "Sidereal Plexus".
@cate_restaurant_leaflet_3_b=Just because it says "Sidereal Plexus" doesn't mean anything.
@cate_restaurant_leaflet_4_b=Sidereal Plexus has more branches than you can imagine.
@cate_restaurant_leaflet_5_b=I had no idea they were running a facility like this, for instance.
@cate_restaurant_leaflet_6_b=But it's only more disturbing when I think about it...
@cate_restaurant_leaflet_7_a=Why?
@cate_restaurant_leaflet_8_b=Forget it. It doesn't matter. Let's keep going.

@cate_construction_conspiracy_1_a=Aliens...?
@cate_construction_conspiracy_2_b=*sigh*
@cate_construction_conspiracy_3_b=No, David.
@cate_construction_conspiracy_4_b=No aliens.
@cate_construction_conspiracy_5_b=Don't believe in everything you read.
@cate_construction_conspiracy_6_b=Even if ... it's not far from the actual truth.
@cate_construction_conspiracy_7_a=It isn't?
@cate_construction_conspiracy_8_b=Let's move, David.

@cate_lab_list_1_a=This is a list of ... hmm ... patients?
@cate_lab_list_2_a=Yes. Sleeper Clinic patients. Each has another name assigned in a "visitor" column.
@cate_lab_list_3_a=I recognize those. Those are Sidereal Plexus officials.
@cate_lab_list_4_a=Why do they match coma patients with visitors?
@cate_lab_list_5_a=Cate...?
@cate_lab_list_6_b=Ugh. I regret ever working for them. I had no idea.
@cate_lab_list_7_a=No idea about what?
@cate_lab_list_8_b=I'll tell you later.
@cate_lab_list_9_b=We have to focus on other things now.

@david_ending_bad_1_a=I feel like something is missing.
@david_ending_bad_2_a=Like I didn't do something important.
@david_ending_bad_3_a=But what? A blurry memory that disappeared too fast.
@david_ending_bad_4_a=I ... don't remember.
@david_ending_bad_5_a=Well, I guess it was just a dream.

@david_ending_med_1_a=I feel there was ... something more in that dream.
@david_ending_med_2_a=Something ... sad ... and important.
@david_ending_med_3_a=Why do I feel like this already happened?
@david_ending_med_4_a=Yet something is different.
@david_ending_med_5_a=I'm gonna find out what.

@wife_too_late_1_a=She is dead. We should probably bury her.
@wife_too_late_2_b=No way. That won't accomplish anything. Just a waste of our precious time.

@dig_treasure_1_b=Did you really want to dig for treasure, David?
@dig_treasure_2_a=I, uh...
@dig_treasure_3_b=Great. Looks like I have TWO kids on my team.

@barry_car0_1_a=We've got a broken car.
@barry_car0_2_c=The world is full of broken cars.
@barry_car0_3_a=Well, maybe we can repair it.
@barry_car0_4_a=Could you help?
@barry_car0_5_c=Sure. Fixing cars kinda used to be my hobby.
@barry_car0_6_c=First, check what's wrong with it. Some parts will probably be missing or need to be replaced..
@barry_car0_7_c=Get those parts and bring them to the car.
@barry_car0_8_c=I'll help you with the repairs.

@barry_car1_1_a=Our car uses so much fuel.
@barry_car1_2_a=I don't think it's normal.
@barry_car1_3_c=There might be a number of reasons for that...
@barry_car1_4_c=From fuel injectors to incorrect tire pressure.
@barry_car1_5_c=There might also be something wrong with the engine.
@barry_car1_6_a=Do you think you could take a look?
@barry_car1_7_c=Sure. Why don't you drive us to my house?
@barry_car1_8_c=I have some tools in my garage.

@barry_car2_1_a=Our car uses so much fuel.
@barry_car2_2_a=I don't think it's normal.
@barry_car2_3_c=There might be a number of reasons for that...
@barry_car2_4_c=From fuel injectors to incorrect tire pressure.
@barry_car2_5_c=There might also be something wrong with the engine.
@barry_car2_6_a=Could you take a look?
@barry_car2_7_c=Sure.

@barry_car_upgraded_1_a=There.
@barry_car_upgraded_2_a=Now it should use much less fuel.

@this_place=About this place...
@this_day=About today...

@place_base_cate_1_a=So, what do you think of our hideout?
@place_base_cate_2_b=It's decent.
@place_base_cate_3_b=High-ground advantage, solid walls, not too many windows.
@place_base_cate_4_a=It has a large helicopter-shaped hole in the roof, though.
@place_base_cate_5_b=...
@place_base_cate_6_b=Your skillful observations amaze me.

@place_base_barry_1_a=What do you think of our hideout, Barry?
@place_base_barry_2_c=What can I say? It's okay.
@place_base_barry_3_c=It's bigger than my house used to be. I think it was a nice place before the world ended.
@place_base_barry_4_a=It's still a good shelter.
@place_base_barry_5_c=A shelter, yes. Home? No. It used to be a home to some people.
@place_base_barry_6_c=It's now like an empty shell of a turtle that once lived.
@place_base_barry_7_b=Oh, Barry. I didn't know you were so poetic.

@place_base_cody_1_a=Do you like it here, Cody?
@place_base_cody_2_c=Yeah, it's awesome!
@place_base_cody_3_c=It's huge and looks comfy and it has a helicopter on the roof!
@place_base_cody_4_c=Why would someone build a house with a helicopter like that?
@place_base_cody_5_a=It wasn't built like that.
@place_base_cody_6_a=The helicopter is Cate's addition.
@place_base_cody_7_c=Oh.
@place_base_cody_8_c=Cate's so cool!
@place_base_cody_9_b=Thanks.
@place_base_cody_10_a=Yeah, it takes real talent to crash into the only house in the middle of a desert.
@place_base_cody_11_b=I was trying to...
@place_base_cody_12_b=You know what? Fine. I'm talented.

@place_road_cate_1_a=So, what do you think of this place?
@place_road_cate_2_b=It's ... a road.
@place_road_cate_3_a=Yeah.
@place_road_cate_4_b=Want me to, I don't know, review the quality of the asphalt?
@place_road_cate_5_a=Why are you like this?
@place_road_cate_6_b=I don't like stupid questions.
@place_road_cate_7_a=I was just trying to start a conversation.
@place_road_cate_8_b=Well that was a weak attempt.

@place_road_barry_1_a=What do you think of this place?
@place_road_barry_2_c=I used to take this road when travelling from my place.
@place_road_barry_3_c=It looked so much different not too long ago.
@place_road_barry_4_c=There was a countryside here, you know?
@place_road_barry_5_c=Cattle in the pastures, crops growing high up all around...
@place_road_barry_6_c=Good times.

@place_road_cody_1_a=Do you like it here, Cody?
@place_road_cody_2_c=Umm, you mean here? On this road?
@place_road_cody_3_c=No ... I don't like it here.
@place_road_cody_4_c=It's windy and there's nothing but sand all around.

@place_gas_station_cate_1_a=So, what do you think of this place?
@place_gas_station_cate_2_b=I saw it from the air and regretfully realized that they probably don't have any helicopter fuel.
@place_gas_station_cate_3_b=Apart from the fuel tank, this hole is pretty much useless.
@place_gas_station_cate_4_b=Let's take what we came for and move on.

@place_gas_station_barry_1_a=What do you think of this place?
@place_gas_station_barry_2_c=I used to fuel my car here often.
@place_gas_station_barry_3_c=They had good prices but the fuel quality was terrible.
@place_gas_station_barry_4_c=I don't think it has changed much since then.
@place_gas_station_barry_5_a=Not that we can be fussy about it.
@place_gas_station_barry_6_c=Sure. It's a miracle this fuel is still here.

@place_gas_station_cody_1_a=Do you like it here, Cody?
@place_gas_station_cody_2_c=It smells weird. It makes me dizzy.
@place_gas_station_cody_3_a=It's gas. Fuel. There's a lot of it in the tank.
@place_gas_station_cody_4_c=Can we go somewhere else?
@place_gas_station_cody_5_a=We will ... just a sec, okay?

@place_restaurant_cate_1_a=So, what do you think of this place?
@place_restaurant_cate_2_b=I saw it from the helicopter and thought it didn't look too bad.
@place_restaurant_cate_3_b=Now I know better.
@place_restaurant_cate_4_a=You've gotta admit it looks solid...
@place_restaurant_cate_5_b=With all those missing windows? It doesn't have any of the advantages of our hideout.
@place_restaurant_cate_6_b=It's also pretty much completely looted.
@place_restaurant_cate_7_a=There might be a thing or two left...
@place_restaurant_cate_8_b=Let me know if you find any coffee, okay?

@place_restaurant_barry_1_a=What do you think of this place?
@place_restaurant_barry_2_c=You know, in all those years living just a bit down the road, I never visited this place.
@place_restaurant_barry_3_a=Any particular reason?
@place_restaurant_barry_4_c=Maggie...
@place_restaurant_barry_5_c=My wife was a great cook.
@place_restaurant_barry_6_c=You should have tasted her steak.
@place_restaurant_barry_7_c=Or her grilled chicken with pasta.
@place_restaurant_barry_8_c=She was...
@place_restaurant_barry_9_c=She was...
@place_restaurant_barry_10_c=Anyway.
@place_restaurant_barry_11_c=I never ate here. But looking at this place from up close, I don't think I missed much.

@place_restaurant_cody_1_a=What do you think of this place, Cody?
@place_restaurant_cody_2_c=When I saw it from a distance I thought they'd have hamburgers.
@place_restaurant_cody_3_c=I like hamburgers...
@place_restaurant_cody_4_b=You don't look like you've had many. All skin and bones.
@place_restaurant_cody_5_c=I didn't find any hamburgers here, obviously!
@place_restaurant_cody_6_c=You kinda know the rest.

@place_bhome_cate_1_a=So, what do you think of this place?
@place_bhome_cate_2_b=You want me to be honest?
@place_bhome_cate_3_a=Wait, no.
@place_bhome_cate_4_a=Forget I asked.

@place_bhome_barry_1_a=So, that was your home, huh?
@place_bhome_barry_2_c=Yes. I lived here with Maggie for almost ten years.
@place_bhome_barry_3_b=Ten years in a place like this? Wow.
@place_bhome_barry_4_a=Cate!
@place_bhome_barry_5_c=Hey. It used to be a nice place, really.
@place_bhome_barry_6_c=Before it partly collapsed, at least.
@place_bhome_barry_7_c=...
@place_bhome_barry_8_c=Maybe it wasn't much even back then.
@place_bhome_barry_9_c=But for us, it was everything.
@place_bhome_barry_10_c=Our little place on Earth.

@place_bhome_cody_1_a=Do you like it here, Cody?
@place_bhome_cody_2_c=This place feels nice.
@place_bhome_cody_3_b=But it's a ruin.
@place_bhome_cody_4_c=Yes, but it ... feels like a good place.
@place_bhome_cody_5_c=Maybe we could stay here?
@place_bhome_cody_6_b=Not a chance.
@place_bhome_cody_7_c=Aww ... but why?
@place_bhome_cody_8_b=Maybe in your next life, okay?

@place_bhome2_cody_1_a=Do you like it here, Cody?
@place_bhome2_cody_2_c=There's a dead person here!
@place_bhome2_cody_3_b=Yeah...
@place_bhome2_cody_4_c=I'm a bit scared.

@place_rv_cate_1_a=So, what do you think of this place?
@place_rv_cate_2_b=Like I said, they must have gone off-road to get past the roadblock.
@place_rv_cate_3_b=And their suspension didn't survive that.
@place_rv_cate_4_b=Consequently, neither did they.

@place_rv_barry_1_a=What do you think of this place?
@place_rv_barry_2_c=This place smells of death.
@place_rv_barry_3_c=Like most of the world, actually.
@place_rv_barry_4_c=...making it a pretty ordinary place, I guess.
@place_rv_barry_5_a=I hope some stuff here will be useful to us.
@place_rv_barry_6_c=Well, surely it won't be useful to the previous owners.
@place_rv_barry_7_c=Looking at all those deaths I can't help myself but wonder:
@place_rv_barry_8_c=How did we ... survive up to this point?
@place_rv_barry_9_a=Maybe it was destiny.
@place_rv_barry_10_c=Destiny. Hah.
@place_rv_barry_11_c=Or blind chance.
@place_rv_barry_12_c=And nothing more.
@place_rv_barry_13_a=Not everything is pointless, Barry.
@place_rv_barry_14_c=Yeah?
@place_rv_barry_15_c=Well, my wife's death was pointless.
@place_rv_barry_16_a=I'm sorry.

@place_rv_cody_1_a=What do you think about this place?
@place_rv_cody_2_c=I wonder where those people were going.
@place_rv_cody_3_c=Like ... there's nothing here!
@place_rv_cody_4_a=And? Any ideas why they were here?
@place_rv_cody_5_c=Maybe ... they wanted to hide a treasure.
@place_rv_cody_6_c=Hey, do you think there's a treasure here or something?
@place_rv_cody_7_a=I doubt that...
@place_rv_cody_8_c=Maybe let's dig?
@place_rv_cody_9_b=Maybe let's not.
@place_rv_cody_10_c=Awww.
@place_rv_cody_11_c=Pssst. David.
@place_rv_cody_12_c=Distract her. I'm gonna dig!
@place_rv_cody_13_b=I hear you, kid.
@place_rv_cody_14_c=Uh oh! Abort! Run away!

@place_rv2_cate_1_a=It must have been fun riding through wastelands with this thing.
@place_rv2_cate_2_b=Well, its end certainly didn't look like fun.
@place_rv2_cate_3_a=Every road ends somewhere, Cate.
@place_rv2_cate_4_b=My road ain't ending in the dust of a wasteland thanks to a broken car.
@place_rv2_cate_5_a=Maybe sometimes it's not about where it ends, but rather how it goes?
@place_rv2_cate_6_b=Nah. Only losers say that.
@place_rv2_cate_7_b=Don't say that.

@place_rv2_barry_1_a=Isn't it a nice RV?
@place_rv2_barry_2_c=Looks cozy.
@place_rv2_barry_3_c=I could probably repair it if we had a few days ... which, of course, we don't have.
@place_rv2_barry_4_c=Not that it would be better than a well-fortified house anyway.

@place_rv2_cody_1_a=Do you like this RV?
@place_rv2_cody_2_c=It's cool!
@place_rv2_cody_3_c=Can we take it? We could travel the world!
@place_rv2_cody_4_a=I think it's broken.
@place_rv2_cody_5_c=Well, there aren't too many nice things to see anyway, so it's okay...

@place_cave_cate_1_a=So, what do you think of this place?
@place_cave_cate_2_b=David, if you were looking for a place that I couldn't compare to a hole in the ground, you've found it.
@place_cave_cate_3_b=This is literally a hole in the ground.
@place_cave_cate_4_b=There is nothing here, just severe cold.

@place_cave_barry_1_a=What do you think of this place?
@place_cave_barry_2_c=It's cold, like Cate's heart.
@place_cave_barry_3_b=Hey!
@place_cave_barry_4_c=What?
@place_cave_barry_5_c=It's an accurate description.
@place_cave_barry_6_a=I think I have to agree.
@place_cave_barry_7_b=You could have said it's dark, like our future.
@place_cave_barry_8_b=Or its bottom is as hard as life has recently become.
@place_cave_barry_9_b=Or that it's shallow, like our current discussion.

@place_cave_cody_1_a=What do you think about this cave?
@place_cave_cody_2_c=It's cold in here!!!
@place_cave_cody_3_b=...cold in here!
@place_cave_cody_4_c=Echo!
@place_cave_cody_5_b=Echo!
@place_cave_cody_6_c=Gekko!
@place_cave_cody_7_b=...ekko!
@place_cave_cody_8_c=Tee-hehehe!
@place_cave_cody_9_b=hehe!

@place_sp_outside_cate_1_a=So, what do you think of this place?
@place_sp_outside_cate_2_b=I was expecting something more, to tell you the truth. I heard so many things about this place, but I never made it here myself.
@place_sp_outside_cate_3_b=Until now of course.
@place_sp_outside_cate_4_a=It was once a huge city.
@place_sp_outside_cate_5_b=The bigger they are...

@place_sp_outside_barry_1_a=What do you think of this place?
@place_sp_outside_barry_2_c=I didn't go to the city too often. Mostly just when Maggie needed something from here and I had to give her a lift.
@place_sp_outside_barry_3_c=Living so close was quite handy. It was quiet in our area, but when we needed something it was only a twenty-minute trip.
@place_sp_outside_barry_4_c=It changed a lot. I mean, just look at all this. It's even worse than anywhere else.
@place_sp_outside_barry_5_a=I wonder what happened to all the people.
@place_sp_outside_barry_6_c=Simple. They either moved out or died, buried in the sand.

@place_sp_outside_cody_1_a=What do you think, Cody?
@place_sp_outside_cody_2_c=It's almost like a disaster movie...
@place_sp_outside_cody_3_c=One time some other boys from the orphanage wanted to watch this film about a huge earthquake. The whole city was devastated!
@place_sp_outside_cody_4_c=It looks similar. Just much more sand.
@place_sp_outside_cody_5_a=We kind of are in a catastrophe movie right now...
@place_sp_outside_cody_6_c=Can I be the main hero?
@place_sp_outside_cody_7_c=And I will save everyone at the end.
@place_sp_outside_cody_8_b=That role is already taken, kid.
@place_sp_outside_cody_9_c=Aww...
@place_sp_outside_cody_10_b=But you can be my sidekick!
@place_sp_outside_cody_11_c=Yay!

@place_sp_inside_cate_1_a=This place is terrifying.
@place_sp_inside_cate_2_a=And dangerous.
@place_sp_inside_cate_3_b=Oh, come on...
@place_sp_inside_cate_4_a=I mean it. Remember what happened on the roof?
@place_sp_inside_cate_5_b=Let's not stay here any longer, then. How about that?
@place_sp_inside_cate_6_b=We have things to do.

@place_sp_inside_barry_1_a=What do you think of this office?
@place_sp_inside_barry_2_c=I hate it.
@place_sp_inside_barry_3_c=I used to hate offices of all kinds.
@place_sp_inside_barry_4_c=Now I have one more reason to do so.
@place_sp_inside_barry_5_a=Yeah...
@place_sp_inside_barry_6_a=I don't like it either.

@place_sp_inside_cody_1_a=What do you think of this office?
@place_sp_inside_cody_2_c=I don't like being here.
@place_sp_inside_cody_3_c=Can we go already?
@place_sp_inside_cody_4_c=This place is ... wrong.
@place_sp_inside_cody_5_c=It's evil.
@place_sp_inside_cody_6_c=Can't you feel it?

@place_construction1_cate_1_a=Any thoughts, Cate?
@place_construction1_cate_2_b=Let's find what can be useful for us and leave.
@place_construction1_cate_3_b=Except for some materials, I'm not sure if there is anything for us here.

@place_construction1_barry_1_a=What do you think of this place?
@place_construction1_barry_2_c=I've heard about it. People from the city started feeling tight in their megalopolis, so this developer decided to build a residential area in the suburbs.
@place_construction1_barry_3_a=As you can see, construction was never finished.
@place_construction1_barry_4_c=Maggie and I didn't like the idea.
@place_construction1_barry_5_c=It would have been too close to our house. We were happy to have a small piece of heaven to ourselves.
@place_construction1_barry_6_c=Kinda silly, I know.

@place_construction1_cody_1_a=Do you like it here, Cody?
@place_construction1_cody_2_c=Wow! So cool! There are so many things here...
@place_construction1_cody_3_c=What does that machine do?
@place_construction1_cody_4_c=Oh! And that one?
@place_construction1_cody_5_c=Hey, look! This thing looks dangerous...
@place_construction1_cody_6_a=Don't touch anything Cody!
@place_construction1_cody_7_c=Hey, hey! Look at that!
@place_construction1_cody_8_a=CODY!

@place_construction2_cate_1_a=Any thoughts, Cate?
@place_construction2_cate_2_b=We've gotta be really careful.
@place_construction2_cate_3_b=This place seems to be swarming with those guys.

@place_construction2_barry_1_a=What do you think, Barry?
@place_construction2_barry_2_c=I think we should leave before they see us.

@place_construction2_cody_1_a=Are you okay, Cody?
@place_construction2_cody_2_c=I'm a bit scared of those bad people...

@place_hunters_cate_1_a=So, what do you think of this place?
@place_hunters_cate_2_b=It's not that great. Could be easily compromised. Door is gone. Even if we secure the windows, it would still be easy to get inside.
@place_hunters_cate_3_a=Do you always have to give me those tactical explanations?
@place_hunters_cate_4_b=What else do you want from me? I never say how I feel. Not even to my therapist.

@place_hunters_barry_1_a=What do you think of this place?
@place_hunters_barry_2_c=I don't have any opinion about it. I know people from the city used to come to this area for hunting season.
@place_hunters_barry_3_c=Everyone has some kind of hobby. That wasn't mine. I hit a deer once while driving. Maggie shouted at me for the rest of the day.
@place_hunters_barry_4_c=I think she was more worried about the deer, though.

@place_hunters_cody_1_a=What's wrong, Cody?
@place_hunters_cody_2_c=I don't like this place. The trees here look scary. I think I saw a monster over there.
@place_hunters_cody_3_a=Monsters don't exist. You don't have to worry about that.
@place_hunters_cody_4_c=I still don't like it. I always wanted to have a cat, but we couldn't have animals in the orphanage. We had a hamster once ... but the other boys didn't take care of it. People here didn't seem to care for animals either.
@place_hunters_cody_5_a=There's always a reason behind everything...

@place_hunters2_cody_1_a=What's wrong, Cody?
@place_hunters2_cody_2_c=I don't like this place. The trees here look scary. I think I saw a monster over there.
@place_hunters2_cody_3_a=Monsters don't exist. Oh, wait. There were those huge spiders. So yeah, maybe they do exist. Now I'm not feeling comfortable either.
@place_hunters2_cody_4_c=W ... what? I'm even more scared! We have to hide before the monsters find us!
@place_hunters2_cody_5_b=Great work, David.

@place_airplane_cate_1_a=So, what do you think of this place?
@place_airplane_cate_2_b=Someone really should take some more flying lessons.
@place_airplane_cate_3_a=Yeah. Too bad not everyone has a god-given talent when it comes to piloting.
@place_airplane_cate_4_a=Or landing.
@place_airplane_cate_5_b=...
@place_airplane_cate_6_b=I will pretend I didn't hear your tone, David.

@place_airplane_barry_1_a=What do you think of this place?
@place_airplane_barry_2_c=It's a desert. And a crashed airplane. I'm not sure what to tell you about it.
@place_airplane_barry_3_c=I hope we find what we need here.
@place_airplane_barry_4_a=Don't you have any story to tell this time?
@place_airplane_barry_5_c=I ... David, what story? This plane wasn't here before the Moon exploded.
@place_airplane_barry_6_c=It was a corn field, I think. Mr. and Mrs. Brown's cornfield.
@place_airplane_barry_7_c=They lived in a two-story house east of here.
@place_airplane_barry_8_c=But it was destroyed during an earthquake. They both moved out, looking for their relatives from the south.
@place_airplane_barry_9_c=So, as you can see...
@place_airplane_barry_10_a=Thanks for the story, Barry.
@place_airplane_barry_11_c=Hah. You're welcome.
@place_airplane_barry_12_c=Sneaky.

@place_airplane_cody_1_a=Do you like it here, Cody?
@place_airplane_cody_2_c=No...
@place_airplane_cody_3_a=Why not?
@place_airplane_cody_4_c=Airplanes are boring.
@place_airplane_cody_5_b=Whoa, now. I wouldn't say...
@place_airplane_cody_6_c=I liked airplanes, but now...
@place_airplane_cody_7_c=I think spaceships are much cooler!
@place_airplane_cody_8_a=He's right, ya know.
@place_airplane_cody_9_b=Shut up.

@place_bus_cate_1_a=What do you think about it? Why is it even here?
@place_bus_cate_2_b=What do I think about what?
@place_bus_cate_3_b=They had a transport, but they got into trouble. Nothing more to explain.

@place_bus_barry_1_a=Any idea what's wrong with that bus?
@place_bus_barry_2_c=I would have to look under the hood, and that would take some time ... which we don't have.
@place_bus_barry_4_a=Besides, I doubt it can move.
@place_bus_barry_5_a=True. Who needs buses anyway?
@place_bus_barry_6_c=I remember seeing buses like that cruising down the road, to and from the city.
@place_bus_barry_7_b=...and?
@place_bus_barry_8_c=And nothing. Sometimes things just spark a memory.

@place_bus_cody_1_a=What do you think, Cody?
@place_bus_cody_2_c=I think I know what happened here.
@place_bus_cody_3_a=Yeah?
@place_bus_cody_4_c=Yeah. I saw it in a movie. There was a policeman and a bad guy.
@place_bus_cody_5_c=And the bad guy put a bomb on a bus.
@place_bus_cody_6_c=And he was like, "If the bus stops, the bomb will explode!"
@place_bus_cody_7_c=BOOOM!
@place_bus_cody_8_a=This bus doesn't look it exploded.
@place_bus_cody_9_c=Because the policeman defused the bomb!

@place_outpost1_cate_1_a=We're here, Cate. The outpost. Are you happy?
@place_outpost1_cate_2_b=I will be once we launch our ship into space.
@place_outpost1_cate_3_a=Anything I should be concerned about here?
@place_outpost1_cate_4_b=Like I said ... defense mechanisms of some sort.
@place_outpost1_cate_5_b=Also, nothing here has been used for quite a while, so don't expect things to work.

@place_outpost1_barry_1_a=What do you think of this place?
@place_outpost1_barry_2_c=I'm not sure. After all this hype from Cate I think I expected something more.
@place_outpost1_barry_3_b=Ugh. There is more. Inside.
@place_outpost1_barry_4_c=This actually reminds me of the time Maggie and I went to a local fair.
@place_outpost1_barry_5_c=It was years ago.
@place_outpost1_barry_6_c=There was this small tent in the middle, and it looked like nothing special...
@place_outpost1_barry_7_c=But inside they put mirrors on all the walls and the columns.
@place_outpost1_barry_8_c=It was lit up with bright lights. It looked incredible.
@place_outpost1_barry_9_c=It was like stepping into infinity, Maggie said.
@place_outpost1_barry_10_c=And she was kinda right.
@place_outpost1_barry_11_c=Then again, all that was just an illusion.

@place_outpost1_cody_1_a=What's on your mind, Cody?
@place_outpost1_cody_2_c=When will we go to space, David?
@place_outpost1_cody_3_a=Just a little longer.
@place_outpost1_cody_4_c=Are we going yet?
@place_outpost1_cody_5_a=No, not yet.
@place_outpost1_cody_6_c=Are we going yet?
@place_outpost1_cody_7_a=Not yet.
@place_outpost1_cody_8_c=And now?
@place_outpost1_cody_9_a=Still not.
@place_outpost1_cody_10_b=How long can you keep going?
@place_outpost1_cody_11_a=Till the end of the world?

@place_outpost2_cate_1_a=So, we're finally here.
@place_outpost2_cate_2_b=Yeah.
@place_outpost2_cate_3_b=It's not over yet. The worst is yet to come.
@place_outpost2_cate_4_a=You know how to lift the spirits up, Cate.
@place_outpost2_cate_5_b=I'm just being realistic.
@place_outpost2_cate_6_b=We got here and that's great. We've been through a lot, but it's still far from over.

@place_outpost2_barry_1_a=What do you think of this place?
@place_outpost2_barry_2_c=I can't believe a private corporation was able to build such a place in secret.
@place_outpost2_barry_3_c=Then they used it to evacuate, just like that.
@place_outpost2_barry_4_c=Without sharing this information with anyone.
@place_outpost2_barry_5_c=Without even trying to save a single soul.
@place_outpost2_barry_6_c=And they supposedly left one of their ships behind because they didn't need both.
@place_outpost2_barry_7_c=There were A LOT of people who would have done anything to board that ship of theirs.
@place_outpost2_barry_8_c=Even if the chances of actually being saved by it were a longshot.

@place_outpost2_cody_1_a=Do you like it here, Cody?
@place_outpost2_cody_2_c=Uh...
@place_outpost2_cody_3_c=It's kinda spooky in here.
@place_outpost2_cody_4_c=Can we just go to space now?
@place_outpost2_cody_5_a=We're working on it.

@place_moon0_cate_1_a=Wow. We made it. We actually made it.
@place_moon0_cate_2_b=I never doubted we would.
@place_moon0_cate_3_b=But....
@place_moon0_cate_4_b=I guess I owe it to you...
@place_moon0_cate_5_b=Come on, let's move. It's not safe in here.

@place_moon0_barry_1_a=How are you holding up?
@place_moon0_barry_2_c=I can't believe we're here.
@place_moon0_barry_3_c=I was sure we'd...
@place_moon0_barry_4_a=Yeah. But we're here.

@place_moon0_cody_1_a=How are you holding up?
@place_moon0_cody_2_c=Uh, I feel dizzy, and I don't like spaceships anymore.
@place_moon0_cody_3_c=Can we go outside yet?
@place_moon0_cody_4_a=You're probably right. We should hurry up.

@place_moon1_cate_1_a=I still can't believe we're here...
@place_moon1_cate_2_b=You'd better start believing.
@place_moon1_cate_3_b=Being on the Moon is the least of the unbelievable things here.
@place_moon1_cate_4_a=What do you mean by that...?
@place_moon1_cate_5_b=Let's get to the Moon base and I'll show you.

@place_moon1_barry_1_a=Welcome to the Moon, Barry.
@place_moon1_barry_2_c=I can't believe we're here.
@place_moon1_barry_3_a=Look at the Earth. Just look at it.
@place_moon1_barry_4_c=Yeah ... I see it.
@place_moon1_barry_5_c=Remember what it looked like when they showed it on TV? It was blue and green.
@place_moon1_barry_6_c=It has changed a lot since then.
@place_moon1_barry_7_c=Soon there won't be even this...
@place_moon1_barry_8_a=Yeah. That's why we have to hurry, I think.

@place_moon1_cody_1_a=We're on the Moon, Cody!
@place_moon1_cody_2_c=Look at me! I'm in space!
@place_moon1_cody_3_a=Yes you are!
@place_moon1_cody_4_c=Yay!
@place_moon1_cody_5_c=This suit is too big for me.
@place_moon1_cody_6_a=Maybe a bit. I think you're doing great, though.
@place_moon1_cody_7_c=But what now?
@place_moon1_cody_8_a=Let's keep going. Just stay close to me!
@place_moon1_cody_9_c=Okay!

@place_moon2_cate_1_a=So, what do you think of this place?
@place_moon2_cate_2_b=It's ... bigger than I imagined.
@place_moon2_cate_3_a=Really? It doesn't look that huge...
@place_moon2_cate_4_b=Look around, David.
@place_moon2_cate_5_b=Most of this is impossible with current technology.
@place_moon2_cate_6_b=Hell, I doubt it's even possible with whatever technology would be available 50 years from now.
@place_moon2_cate_7_a=So ... what does that mean, exactly?
@place_moon2_cate_8_b=It means Sidereal Plexus likes to borrow technology from other places.

@place_moon2_barry_1_a=What do you think of this place?
@place_moon2_barry_2_c=It feels like I'm in a dream.
@place_moon2_barry_3_a=Maybe we are.
@place_moon2_barry_4_c=It surely is ... otherworldly in here.

@place_moon2_cody_1_a=What do you think of this place?
@place_moon2_cody_2_c=I don't know.
@place_moon2_cody_3_c=This place is cool, but I'm also scared.
@place_moon2_cody_4_c=Is there a name for this feeling?
@place_moon2_cody_5_a=Hmm. You're ... awestruck?
@place_moon2_cody_6_c=And a bit dizzy.

@place_bridge0_cate_1_a=What's on your mind, Cate?
@place_bridge0_cate_2_b=This ravine could use a bridge.
@place_bridge0_cate_3_b=We should build one with those long planks by the truck.
@place_bridge0_cate_4_b=If you have a hammer and some nails, that is.

@place_bridge1_cate_1_a=How do you like the bridge, Cate?
@place_bridge1_cate_2_b=It's more like a gangway.
@place_bridge1_cate_3_b=If we make a second one like the first, it would be crossable with a car, I think.

@place_bridge2_cate_1_a=Isn't this a nice bridge?
@place_bridge2_cate_2_b=It'll have to do, I guess.
@place_bridge2_cate_3_b=Oh, don't give me that look.
@place_bridge2_cate_4_b=Fine. I'm so proud of you.
@place_bridge2_cate_5_b=Should I also pat your back?

@place_bridge0_barry_1_c=Oh. The bridge is gone.
@place_bridge0_barry_2_b=You don't say! I hadn't noticed!
@place_bridge0_barry_3_c=Maybe we could do something about it?
@place_bridge0_barry_4_c=We won't be able to rebuild the proper thing, but perhaps a makeshift one?

@place_bridge1_barry_1_a=Not a perfect bridge, but it'll have to do, huh?
@place_bridge1_barry_2_c=I remember the bridge that used to be here.
@place_bridge1_barry_3_c=It was quite a nice little bridge. Very strong, too.
@place_bridge1_barry_4_b=It didn't survive the test of time, I'm afraid.
@place_bridge1_barry_5_c=You know, if we build another gangway next to the first one, it should be crossable by a car.

@place_bridge2_barry_1_a=This bridge is almost like the end of the world never happened, am I right?
@place_bridge2_barry_2_c=Well...
@place_bridge2_barry_3_c=How do I break this to you?
@place_bridge2_barry_4_c=This ... isn't necessarily the finest bridge I've seen in my life.
@place_bridge2_barry_5_c=But, okay. It looks sturdy enough for a car to cross it. I'll give you that.

@place_bridge0_cody_1_a=Don't come close to the ravine, Cody!
@place_bridge0_cody_2_c=It's not even that deep!
@place_bridge0_cody_3_c=But I guess going through it takes a lot of time.
@place_bridge0_cody_4_c=I know! Let's build a bridge!
@place_bridge0_cody_5_b=The kid might be onto something...

@place_bridge1_cody_1_a=Don't run across the gangway, Cody!
@place_bridge1_cody_2_c=I'm not going to. It doesn't look very solid, David!
@place_bridge1_cody_3_a=Hah. I did my best.
@place_bridge1_cody_4_c=Well, if you add a second bridge like that, two people could go in different directions at the same time!

@place_bridge2_cody_1_a=How do you like the bridge, Cody?
@place_bridge2_cody_2_c=Hmm ... it could use some paint.
@place_bridge2_cody_3_a=We don't have any.
@place_bridge2_cody_4_c=Yellow would be nice. Or green. I like green.

@d2_cold_cate_1_a=Isn't it chilly?
@d2_cold_cate_2_b=Your dream seems to be fulfilling itself.
@d2_cold_cate_3_a=If that's the case, there's going to be a surge of extreme cold right after it gets dark.
@d2_cold_cate_4_a=What could have caused it?
@d2_cold_cate_5_b=Well, Earth's climate is a chaotic mess. This sort of thing happens more and more frequently now.
@d2_cold_cate_6_b=It's probably a temporary event. Temperature should be back to normal tomorrow.
@d2_cold_cate_7_a=I hope we get to see that happen.
@d2_cold_cate_8_b=Of course we will.
@d2_cold_cate_9_b=As I said, David. I have plans.
@d2_cold_cate_10_b=Places to visit.
@d2_cold_cate_11_b=A spaceship to grab.
@d2_cold_cate_12_b=A little snow storm ain't gonna stop me.

@d2_cold_barry_1_a=It's getting cold.
@d2_cold_barry_2_c=Indeed, it's a bit chilly.
@d2_cold_barry_3_c=We're gonna need all the warmth we can get.
@d2_cold_barry_4_c=If you intend to keep a fire lit in a fireplace or something like that, make sure you gather some reserve fuel.
@d2_cold_barry_5_c=And maybe some extra kindling. With those freezing cold winds, you never know...
@d2_cold_barry_6_a=That's good advice. Thanks.
@d2_cold_barry_7_a=How are you holding up, Barry?
@d2_cold_barry_8_c=Better. Given that I was willing to freeze to death, I'd say I got much better.
@d2_cold_barry_9_c=And that's thanks to you.
@d2_cold_barry_10_a=We didn't do anything.
@d2_cold_barry_11_c=Come on. I know I was a mess. I hate being helpless, yet there I was, unable to even bury my own dead wife.
@d2_cold_barry_12_b=Admission is the first step to recovery.
@d2_cold_barry_13_c=Actually, denial was, in my case.

@d2_cold_cody_1_a=Are you fine, Cody?
@d2_cold_cody_2_c=Yeah. I'm wondering if we could make a snowman.
@d2_cold_cody_3_a=Well...
@d2_cold_cody_4_b=David.
@d2_cold_cody_5_a=...We don't have time for that. And it's going to be really cold.
@d2_cold_cody_6_c=Oh ... too bad. I always wanted to make one.
@d2_cold_cody_7_b=...
@d2_cold_cody_8_b=I'm not evil, okay?
@d2_cold_cody_8_b=We have to conserve our strength. Conserve the heat. We can't just start playing in the snow.
@d2_cold_cody_9_b=If we get through it, we'll make a snowman in the morning. Okay, kid?
@d2_cold_cody_10_c=Sure!

@d2_hot_cate_1_a=It's getting hot...
@d2_hot_cate_2_b=Your dream seems to be fulfilling itself.
@d2_hot_cate_3_a=If that's the case, there's going to be a surge of extreme heat right after it gets dark.
@d2_hot_cate_4_a=What could have caused it?
@d2_hot_cate_5_b=Well, Earth's climate is a chaotic mess. This sort of thing happens more and more frequently now.
@d2_hot_cate_6_b=It's probably a temporary event. Temperature should be back to normal tomorrow.
@d2_hot_cate_7_a=I hope we get to see that happen.
@d2_hot_cate_8_b=Of course we will.
@d2_hot_cate_9_b=As I said, David. I have plans.
@d2_hot_cate_10_b=Places to visit.
@d2_hot_cate_11_b=A spaceship to grab.
@d2_hot_cate_12_b=Risk of heat stroke ain't gonna stop me.

@d2_hot_barry_1_a=It's getting really hot...
@d2_hot_barry_2_c=Yeah. I'm all sweaty.
@d2_hot_barry_3_b=I can tell.
@d2_hot_barry_4_c=I've always handled high temperatures poorly...
@d2_hot_barry_5_c=Are you sure it's gonna get worse?
@d2_hot_barry_6_c=Temperature usually drops in the evening...
@d2_hot_barry_7_a=Not this time.
@d2_hot_barry_8_a=The worst heat will be just after sunset.
@d2_hot_barry_9_c=That's not normal.
@d2_hot_barry_10_a=Nothing here is, Barry.


@d2_hot_cody_1_a=It's hot, isn't it?
@d2_hot_cody_2_c=Yes ... it's really hot.
@d2_hot_cody_3_c=I'm melting!
@d2_hot_cody_4_c=Is there any lake nearby? Or maybe a pool? Yeah, a pool would be amazing. Can we look for one?
@d2_hot_cody_5_a=I don't think we have time for that...
@d2_hot_cody_6_c=But it's sooooo hot! I'm sure I could swim the pool faster than you!
@d2_hot_cody_7_a=I give up. I won't even try. Congratulations.
@d2_hot_cody_8_c=Yaaay, I won!

@d3_sidereal_cate_1_a=Any ideas for today?
@d3_sidereal_cate_2_b=Before we start even thinking about what comes later, we HAVE TO go to the Sidereal Plexus office.
@d3_sidereal_cate_3_b=Let's get back to this talk after we're done with that, okay?

@d3_sidereal_barry_1_a=Are you worried about tonight?
@d3_sidereal_barry_2_c=Tonight? I'm worried about this whole Sidereal Plexus thing.
@d3_sidereal_barry_3_c=That office is in the city. Nobody lives or goes there.
@d3_sidereal_barry_4_c=And I have a bad feeling about it.

@d3_sidereal_cody_1_a=What is it, Cody?
@d3_sidereal_cody_2_a=Worried about tonight?
@d3_sidereal_cody_3_c=Yes, but also...
@d3_sidereal_cody_4_c=Do we have to go to that Sideplexthing office?
@d3_sidereal_cody_5_c=It sounds kinda scary.

@d3_thugs_cate_1_a=Any ideas for today?
@d3_thugs_cate_2_b=The best defense is a good offense.
@d3_thugs_cate_3_a=What?!
@d3_thugs_cate_4_b=Don't "what" me. If we want to have any chance, we need to go to their camp and do as much as possible to stop them. A little sabotage won't hurt.
@d3_thugs_cate_5_b=Actually ... maybe it will.
@d3_thugs_cate_6_b=It will hurt them. But that's the point.
@d3_thugs_cate_7_b=Just make sure we don't get spotted. We wouldn't stand a chance in an open fight like that.

@d3_thugs_barry_1_a=Are you worried about tonight?
@d3_thugs_barry_2_c=A little. I mean, we are clearly outnumbered. They probably know how to use weapons.
@d3_thugs_barry_3_b=I'm quite good with those as well!
@d3_thugs_barry_4_c=At least one of us is. It won't be enough to defend our hideout. We need to do our best fortifying this place.

@d3_thugs_cody_1_a=What is it, Cody?
@d3_thugs_cody_2_c=You said there are bandits. Can't we just talk to them?
@d3_thugs_cody_3_b=They are bad people, Cody. They won't listen.
@d3_thugs_cody_4_c=I chatted with you yesterday even though you could have been evil...
@d3_thugs_cody_5_a=I wish it was that simple.
@d3_thugs_cody_6_c=Maybe with some of them...?
@d3_thugs_cody_7_b=Cody...

@d3_storm_cate_1_a=Any thoughts about today?
@d3_storm_cate_2_b=Don't ask me. Thunderstorms are not afraid of bullets.
@d3_storm_cate_3_a=Do you always resolve issues with a gun?
@d3_storm_cate_4_b=Do you have any issues with me?
@d3_storm_cate_5_a=Um ... no. Not at all. I was just curious.
@d3_storm_cate_6_b=I'm glad we settled that. Back to the topic. The acid rain will be a huge problem. I think we should cover as many holes as possible.
@d3_storm_cate_7_a=That's a valid point.

@d3_storm_barry_1_a=I need ideas, Barry.
@d3_storm_barry_2_c=Uhh ... I don't really know. It's not like we had many heavy storms in the area during the past few years. I mean, when everything was normal.
@d3_storm_barry_3_c=We had a lightning rod on the roof. I put it there after one incident. It's probably gone now, but if we had something similar maybe it would help?
@d3_storm_barry_4_a=Maybe...

@d3_storm_cody_1_a=You look worried. Is something wrong?
@d3_storm_cody_2_c=Uh ... nothing.
@d3_storm_cody_3_a=Are you sure? You know you can tell me.
@d3_storm_cody_4_c=Hmpf. I'm fine. I'm not afraid of thunderstorms.
@d3_storm_cody_5_a=I didn't say you were.
@d3_storm_cody_6_c=But you thought it!
@d3_storm_cody_7_a=No, I didn't.
@d3_storm_cody_8_c=Yes, you did! That's why you asked me if I'm fine!
@d3_storm_cody_9_c=And I'm fine! Who would be scared of a storm?
@d3_storm_cody_10_c=Not me.
@d3_storm_cody_11_c=Not at all.

@d4_ship_cate_1_a=So, today is the day.
@d4_ship_cate_2_b=Yes.
@d4_ship_cate_3_b=We either fly or we fry.
@d4_ship_cate_4_a=I can't believe you're able to joke about Earth being destroyed.
@d4_ship_cate_5_a=Then again ... I can hardly believe the Earth is being destroyed in the first place.
@d4_ship_cate_6_b=Well, yes. This world is lost.
@d4_ship_cate_7_b=There is nothing we can do. Just escape.
@d4_ship_cate_8_a=I guess you're not sharing any more details on our actual plan of what we do once we take off?
@d4_ship_cate_9_b=Listen. Right now taking off isn't even certain.
@d4_ship_cate_10_b=The ship might not fly, or it might explode in the air if it's damaged.
@d4_ship_cate_11_b=There are a million things that can go wrong.
@d4_ship_cate_12_b=So, yes. Let's focus on those things now.
@d4_ship_cate_13_b=You'll learn about everything soon enough.

@d4_ship_barry_1_a=Thinking about your wife?
@d4_ship_barry_2_c=All the time.
@d4_ship_barry_3_c=Today is the last day of the world.
@d4_ship_barry_4_c=Just ... just listen to this.
@d4_ship_barry_5_c=The end. Of the world. Is today.
@d4_ship_barry_6_c=I can't believe it. I can't comprehend it.
@d4_ship_barry_7_c=It's not something I expected ... nor wanted to witness.
@d4_ship_barry_8_a=If we're lucky we're gonna witness it from far above.
@d4_ship_barry_9_c=Yeah ... if we're lucky.
@d4_ship_barry_10_a=You don't believe we can make it, do you?
@d4_ship_barry_11_c=It doesn't matter. Even if we do, the end of the world means it's the end of the world.
@d4_ship_barry_12_c=So I don't believe we can escape our fate.
@d4_ship_barry_13_c=But you can be sure as hell I'll do everything to help you get where you want to go.
@d4_ship_barry_14_c=So, you can still count on me.
@d4_ship_barry_15_a=Thanks, Barry.

@d4_ship_cody_1_a=You look anxious.
@d4_ship_cody_2_c=I can't wait.
@d4_ship_cody_3_c=I wanna go to space already!
@d4_ship_cody_4_c=Also, Cate says the Moon is gonna hit Earth today.
@d4_ship_cody_5_c=Can we watch that from above?
@d4_ship_cody_6_c=Because that sounds, like, really dangerous.
@d4_ship_cody_7_a=Sure. We will be safe in our spaceship.
@d4_ship_cody_8_a=In space.
@d4_ship_cody_9_c=Can I tell you a secret, David?
@d4_ship_cody_10_a=Sure.
@d4_ship_cody_11_c=I'm scared. Like, almost all the time.
@d4_ship_cody_12_c=I'm just trying to think about going to space so I don't think about the end of the world...
@d4_ship_cody_13_a=Cody...
@d4_ship_cody_14_c=What?
@d4_ship_cody_15_a=I just want to say I'm proud of you.
@d4_ship_cody_16_c=Umm ... for what? For being scared?
@d4_ship_cody_17_a=Fear is something we all feel, Cody. Feeling fear doesn't mean you're not brave.
@d4_ship_cody_18_a=And you're the bravest kid I've ever met.
@d4_ship_cody_19_c=I am?
@d4_ship_cody_20_a=Yes. And I'm sure you'll love it in space!

@dialogue_sarge_thugs_caption=About Sarge...
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_cate_1_a=What? Why are you looking at me like that?
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_cate_2_b=I'm just wondering why you let that guy live. It would be easier to deal with them one by one.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_cate_3_a=I'm not some cold blooded murderer...
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_cate_4_b=You realize that we are living in times when it's us or them, right?
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_cate_5_b=It's not some fairy tale with a happy ending. Stop acting like a child, David. Grow up.

@dialogue_sarge_thugs2_cate_1_a=Maybe there is a happy ending after all.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs2_cate_2_b=No, David. There isn't. Not for them. Who knows if there is one for us?
@dialogue_sarge_thugs2_cate_3_a=Stop being so pessimistic, Cate. We did a good thing today.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs2_cate_4_b=It's called being realistic.

@dialogue_sarge_thugs3_cate_1_a=Maybe there is a happy ending after all.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs3_cate_2_b=Maybe there is. Who knows?

@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_cate_1_a=I don't feel good about it.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_cate_2_b=Get used to it. It won't get any easier.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_cate_3_a=I know.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_cate_4_b=Turn off your remorse. We need to move forward. Evening will be much worse than that.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_cate_5_a=I don't want to agree with you ... but you're probably right.

@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_barry_1_a=Do you think we made a mistake?
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_barry_2_c=Why? Of course not. We'd be no better than those thugs if we started killing everyone we see.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_barry_3_c=There must be another way. We are not animals.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_barry_4_a=Yeah, you're right. I just hope we don't regret that decision.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_barry_5_c=Stick to what you believe, David. No matter what.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_barry_6_c=Maggie always said that. Your action describes who you are.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_barry_7_c=And you are a good guy.

@dialogue_sarge_thugs2_barry_1_a=That went better than I expected.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs2_barry_2_c=He seemed reasonable. He didn't want to do us any harm.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs2_barry_3_c=Even if we have to deal with the rest ... it's still a few saved lives.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs2_barry_4_a=For now...
@dialogue_sarge_thugs2_barry_5_c=What happens next doesn't depend on us. We did all we could.

@dialogue_sarge_thugs3_barry_1_a=That went better than I expected.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs3_barry_2_c=He seemed reasonable. He didn't want to do us any harm.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs3_barry_3_c=Even if we have to deal with the rest ... it's still a few saved lives.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs3_barry_4_a=Maybe there is still hope after all.

@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_barry_1_a=I'm feeling guilty even without your judgement, Barry.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_barry_2_c=I'm still going to judge you. I put faith in you, I believed you, and ... it's not what I wanted.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_barry_3_c=It's totally not what I wanted.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_barry_4_a=What else could I do?
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_barry_5_c=Talk to him? Find another solution? It's so easy to grab a gun and end everything with force.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_barry_6_c=Discussion takes too much effort.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_barry_7_a=Even if ... he could betray us.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_barry_8_c=He could also help us. You never know. You didn't even try.


@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_cody_1_a=Hmm...
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_cody_2_c=Are you worried about something?
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_cody_3_a=No. I'm fine. Well ... yeah. Maybe a little.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_cody_4_c=If it's about that soldier, you don't have to be worried.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_cody_5_c=He looked like a good guy. I'm pretty sure I can recognize a villain.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_cody_6_c=I read a lot of comic books.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs1_cody_7_a=Good to have a specialist in the field.

@dialogue_sarge_thugs2_cody_1_a=So, the Sarge...
@dialogue_sarge_thugs2_cody_2_c=I knew he wasn't a villain!
@dialogue_sarge_thugs2_cody_3_a=You were right, Cody. He wasn't a villain.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs2_cody_4_c=Yaay! One point for the good guys!

@dialogue_sarge_thugs3_cody_1_a=So, the Sarge...
@dialogue_sarge_thugs3_cody_2_c=I knew he wasn't a villain!
@dialogue_sarge_thugs3_cody_3_a=You were right, Cody. He wasn't a villain.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs3_cody_4_c=Just like last time. He was a good guy.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs3_cody_5_a=What do you mean "last time"?
@dialogue_sarge_thugs3_cody_6_c=The last time we met him!
@dialogue_sarge_thugs3_cody_7_a=Cody, we've never met him...
@dialogue_sarge_thugs3_cody_8_a=Wait, I'm confused.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs3_cody_9_c=Uh, me too. Thinking about it makes me dizzy...!

@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_cody_1_a=Cody?
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_cody_2_c=I'm not talking to you.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_cody_3_a=Why?
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_cody_4_c=You know why.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_cody_5_a=But we are talking right now. You can tell me what's wrong.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_cody_6_c=...
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_cody_7_a=Is it about the soldier? We had...
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_cody_8_c=I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_cody_9_a=I mean ... I had to do it. To protect us.
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_cody_10_c=It shouldn't work like that...
@dialogue_sarge_thugs4_cody_11_a=I know...

@dialogue_sarge_storm_caption=About Sarge...
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cate_1_a=About Sarge...
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cate_2_b=What about him?
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cate_3_a=You have any thoughts about him?
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cate_4_b=He can be useful. He and his men.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cate_5_a=You really think of them as some kind of ... resource?
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cate_6_b=It's not like we can join forces with them.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cate_7_b=They have their group, and we have ours. We should focus mainly on our own survival. If they can help us, I'm fine with that.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cate_8_b=They aren't even helping us for free, so like I said, everyone thinks about themselves.

@dialogue_sarge_storm1_barry_1_a=About Sarge...
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_barry_2_c=I didn't realize there were still military units working in the field.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_barry_3_a=It's probably all that's left of them.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_barry_4_c=Are you sure? They've gotta have some sort of chain of command still in place.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_barry_5_a=That's not what Sarge said.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_barry_6_b=Why can't you come to terms with the fact it's all gone?
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_barry_7_b=Apart from some bandit groups or random survivors like us, there's nobody left.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_barry_8_c=I know, I know.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_barry_9_c=Anyway, he seems to be a decent person.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_barry_10_c=And he cares for his men, so ... I guess he's alright.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_barry_11_c=I'm quite happy we had a chance to meet him on our journey.

@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_1_a=So, what do you think about Sarge?
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_2_c=I think he's a brave general, and he fights the bad guys.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_3_b=Sarge. Not a general. Sarge, as in sergeant.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_4_c=Oh. I thought that was his name!
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_5_c=Anyway, I wish I was in his squad!
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_6_c=I'd have a cool gun, and I'd be fighting the bad guys with general Sarge!
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_7_b=Guns are not for kids.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_8_c=I'm not a...
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_9_b=So, when are you leaving?
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_10_c=What...?
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_11_b=When are you leaving to join Sarge and his men.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_12_c=I ... no! I don't want to go!
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_13_c=David!
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_14_c=Cate!
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_15_c=I didn't mean it!
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_16_a=Calm down, Cody. You're not going anywhere.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_17_c=Phew...
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_18_a=Cate. You seriously have to stop saying stuff like that.
@dialogue_sarge_storm1_cody_19_b=Hahaha. But did you see the look on his face?

@dialogue_razor_caption=About Razor...

@d4_kill_razor0_cate_1_a=About killing Razor...
@d4_kill_razor0_cate_2_a=Are you sure we did the right thing?
@d4_kill_razor0_cate_3_b=He got what he deserved.
@d4_kill_razor0_cate_4_b=Nothing else to add.
@d4_kill_razor0_cate_5_b=I would shoot him again if I had the chance to.
@d4_kill_razor0_cate_6_a=I'm not sure ... I mean, we had to kill the attackers, but Razor was defenseless in the end.

@d4_kill_razor1_cate_1_b=You didn't have any issues with killing the camp guard.
@d4_kill_razor2_cate_1_b=You didn't have any issues with killing the military guy at the gas station.
@d4_kill_razor3_cate_1_b=You didn't have any issues with killing the camp guard or the military guy at the gas station.

@d4_kill_razor4_cate_1_b=So, stop pretending you're so innocent.
@d4_kill_razor4_cate_2_b=Because I know you aren't.

@d4_kill_razor5_cate_1_b=You want to think you're innocent.
@d4_kill_razor5_cate_2_b=But we both know you're not.

@d4_kill_razor0_barry_1_a=About Razor...
@d4_kill_razor0_barry_2_c=Don't even start with this one.
@d4_kill_razor0_barry_3_c=You don't kill a man when he can't harm you.
@d4_kill_razor0_barry_4_c=This is bad.
@d4_kill_razor0_barry_5_c=I really didn't think I'd have to explain it to you.

@d4_kill_razor1_barry_1_c=But seeing how you dealt with that camp guard...

@d4_kill_razor2_barry_1_c=But seeing you shoot that former soldier at the gas station...

@d4_kill_razor3_barry_1_c=But seeing you shoot that former soldier at the gas station and knowing how you dealt with that camp guard...

@d4_kill_razor4_barry_1_c=Maybe I shouldn't be surprised.
@d4_kill_razor4_barry_2_c=It's a pity, because I thought better of you.
@d4_kill_razor4_barry_3_c=Sorry to break it to you like that.

@d4_kill_razor5_barry_1_c=I just...
@d4_kill_razor5_barry_2_c=I just thought better of you, looking at your past actions.

@d4_kill_razor0_cody_1_a=Cody...
@d4_kill_razor0_cody_2_c=Killing is bad.
@d4_kill_razor0_cody_3_a=We had to...
@d4_kill_razor0_cody_4_c=Killing is bad!
@d4_kill_razor0_cody_5_a=I wanted to keep you safe. I didn't want him to be able to hurt you.
@d4_kill_razor0_cody_6_c=But ... killing is bad.
@d4_kill_razor0_cody_7_c=All people should be friends.

@d4_kill_razor1_cody_1_c=At the construction site you killed a guard.

@d4_kill_razor2_cody_1_c=At the gas station you killed a soldier.

@d4_kill_razor3_cody_1_c=You killed a guard at the construction site and a soldier at the gas station.

@d4_kill_razor4_cody_1_c=Then you killed more of them when they came.
@d4_kill_razor4_cody_2_a=I did it to protect you, Cody.
@d4_kill_razor4_cody_3_c=I don't think you had to kill all of them.
@d4_kill_razor4_cody_4_c=Maybe some wouldn't listen, but others might have.
@d4_kill_razor4_cody_5_c=Why can't everyone be friends?
@d4_kill_razor4_cody_6_c=I don't get it...

@d4_kill_razor5_cody_1_a=I did it to protect you, Cody.
@d4_kill_razor5_cody_2_c=Did you?
@d4_kill_razor5_cody_3_c=Not because of revenge?
@d4_kill_razor5_cody_4_a=No, of course not.

@d4_spare_razor0_cate_1_a=About letting Razor go...
@d4_spare_razor0_cate_2_b=Do not talk to me about that.
@d4_spare_razor0_cate_3_b=You convinced me. I already regret that.
@d4_spare_razor0_cate_4_a=Why?
@d4_spare_razor0_cate_5_b=Because I showed weakness. Because I looked like some sort of wimp.
@d4_spare_razor0_cate_6_b=No offense.
@d4_spare_razor0_cate_7_a=Cate, this man has lost all his friends. He lost everything.
@d4_spare_razor0_cate_8_b=Which makes him super dangerous, as he has nothing left to lose now.
@d4_spare_razor0_cate_9_b=What if he decides to come back?
@d4_spare_razor0_cate_10_a=I doubt that.
@d4_spare_razor0_cate_11_b=If I were him, I would totally come back and have my revenge.
@d4_spare_razor0_cate_12_a=Yes, you probably would.
@d4_spare_razor0_cate_13_b=Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

@d4_spare_razor0_barry_1_a=About Razor...
@d4_spare_razor0_barry_2_c=You did the right thing, David. There was enough bloodshed. No reason to take another life. We did what we had to do to defend ourselves, and that's enough.
@d4_spare_razor0_barry_3_a=What if he decides to get back at us?
@d4_spare_razor0_barry_4_c=I'm not sure he has time for a revenge. Don't you think?
@d4_spare_razor0_barry_5_a=I guess...

@d4_spare_razor0_cody_1_a=Razor is free. I hope you're not scared by that.
@d4_spare_razor0_cody_2_c=No. Bad guys always lose. No matter what.
@d4_spare_razor0_cody_3_a=So are you saying that the good guys always let the bad guys leave?
@d4_spare_razor0_cody_4_c=Yeah. Most of the time. Then they can return in other comic books and make some more trouble.
@d4_spare_razor0_cody_5_a=But you said you are not afraid of him coming back.
@d4_spare_razor0_cody_6_c=Yeah, because we're gonna beat him again!

@helicopter_barry_1_c=Soon after my wife died I heard your helicopter.
@helicopter_barry_2_c=I walked outside just in time to see you fly over the house.
@helicopter_barry_3_b=Yeah. I wasn't sure if the place was abandoned or not.
@helicopter_barry_4_c=Why didn't you land there if you were low on fuel?
@helicopter_barry_5_b=I was trying to touch down this baby since I had flown past the city.
@helicopter_barry_6_b=It was not particularly operative.
@helicopter_barry_7_c=Are those ... bullet holes?
@helicopter_barry_8_b=It's a long story.

@helicopter_cody_1_c=WOW!!!
@helicopter_cody_2_c=It's so awesome!
@helicopter_cody_3_b=I flew it, you know.
@helicopter_cody_4_a=She flew it IN here.
@helicopter_cody_5_c=Helicopters are cool.
@helicopter_cody_6_c=Can I get inside?
@helicopter_cody_7_b=Not the best idea, kid.
@helicopter_cody_8_c=But...
@helicopter_cody_9_b=Don't touch it. Don't even come near it.
@helicopter_cody_10_c=But why...?
@helicopter_cody_11_a=Because it might fall.
@helicopter_cody_12_a=I wouldn't want you to fall and hurt yourself.

@place_sidereal_auto_barry_1_c=How big do you think this place is?
@place_sidereal_auto_barry_2_a=No idea.
@place_sidereal_auto_barry_3_c=It looked quite big from the outside...
@place_sidereal_auto_barry_4_c=And it's probably mostly buried with sand.
@place_sidereal_auto_barry_5_c=I hope we find those coordinates fast.
@place_sidereal_auto_barry_6_a=Yeah...
@place_sidereal_auto_barry_7_c=Lead the way, but watch your step.

@place_sidereal_auto_cody_1_c=It's so dark in here...
@place_sidereal_auto_cody_2_a=Don't be scared, Cody.
@place_sidereal_auto_cody_3_c=I'm not!
@place_sidereal_auto_cody_4_c=...
@place_sidereal_auto_cody_5_c=What was that?
@place_sidereal_auto_cody_6_c=I am scared.
@place_sidereal_auto_cody_7_c=I don't want to be here.
@place_sidereal_auto_cody_8_a=Hey, it's okay. I'm here.
@place_sidereal_auto_cody_9_a=We'll get what we came for, and then we'll just leave.
@place_sidereal_auto_cody_10_c=Okay...

@place_sidereal_auto2_barry_1_c=David...
@place_sidereal_auto2_barry_2_a=Yes?
@place_sidereal_auto2_barry_3_c=About Cody...
@place_sidereal_auto2_barry_4_a=Listen. It wasn't an easy choice, okay?
@place_sidereal_auto2_barry_5_a=If I could have saved both of you, I would have.
@place_sidereal_auto2_barry_6_c=I know, David.
@place_sidereal_auto2_barry_7_c=Do you think he suffered?
@place_sidereal_auto2_barry_8_a=I ... hope he didn't.

@place_sidereal_auto2_cody_1_c=Umm...
@place_sidereal_auto2_cody_2_a=What happened?
@place_sidereal_auto2_cody_3_c=Nothing...
@place_sidereal_auto2_cody_4_c=David?
@place_sidereal_auto2_cody_5_c=Do you think...?
@place_sidereal_auto2_cody_6_c=Do you think Barry is alive?
@place_sidereal_auto2_cody_7_a=...
@place_sidereal_auto2_cody_8_a=I don't know, kid.
@place_sidereal_auto2_cody_9_c=I hope he's okay...
@place_sidereal_auto2_cody_10_a=Me too...

@barry_base_welcome_1_c=So, this is the place you stayed at?
@barry_base_welcome_2_a=Yes.
@barry_base_welcome_3_c=It's ... big. Looks solid.
@barry_base_welcome_4_a=Despite Cate's best attempts, it still stands.
@barry_base_welcome_5_a=And I think it can provide us with the protection we need.
@barry_base_welcome_6_a=At least until we figure out what to do next.
@barry_base_welcome_7_c=I knew the people who lived here.
@barry_base_welcome_8_a=Really?
@barry_base_welcome_9_c=I'll tell you about them if you want.

@cody_base_welcome_1_c=That's your home?
@cody_base_welcome_2_c=It's so cool!!!
@cody_base_welcome_3_a=It's not my home. I found it deserted.
@cody_base_welcome_4_c=Oh.
@cody_base_welcome_5_c=It's still cool!
@cody_base_welcome_6_c=Can we go upstairs? I saw a helicopter sticking out of it.
@cody_base_welcome_7_a=Calm down, Cody!

@barry_base_family_caption=The people who lived in our hideout...
@barry_base_family_1_a=You said you knew the people who lived in our hideout?
@barry_base_family_2_b=We weren't really close, but we spoke on occasion.
@barry_base_family_3_a=What happened to them?
@barry_base_family_4_a=I always wondered. The house was locked, and I didn't find any bodies. So, I guess the set of keys I found must have been spares.
@barry_base_family_5_b=They left. The military was still trying to evacuate civilians from endangered areas until they realized there were no safe areas left.
@barry_base_family_6_a=Didn't you want to go with them?
@barry_base_family_7_b=We refused.
@barry_base_family_8_b=Maggie wanted to stay.
@barry_base_family_9_b=Now I wonder. What if...?
@barry_base_family_10_b=Then again, I have no idea what happened to the ones who left.
@barry_base_family_11_b=I hope they're alright.
@barry_base_family_12_b=But I doubt they are.

@barry_cody_first_meet_1_b=So ... you've been all on your own till now?
@barry_cody_first_meet_2_c=Pretty much, yes.
@barry_cody_first_meet_3_b=Well now it's gonna be different. You should be safer.
@barry_cody_first_meet_4_b=I'm Barry, by the way.
@barry_cody_first_meet_5_c=Cody.
@barry_cody_first_meet_6_b=Those two, David and Cate ... They helped me get through some sad moments.
@barry_cody_first_meet_7_c=Oh, they are nice.
@barry_cody_first_meet_8_b=Yeah ... hard to find that these days.
@barry_cody_first_meet_9_c=Hey, if you're still sad, do you want some of that canned food?
@barry_cody_first_meet_10_b=Thanks, kid, but I don't need it. It's all yours!
@barry_cody_first_meet_11_c=Yumm!
@barry_cody_first_meet_12_c=Okay, let's go then!

@cody_barry_first_meet_1_c=Hey, mister?
@cody_barry_first_meet_2_b=Yes?
@cody_barry_first_meet_3_c=I'm Cody.
@cody_barry_first_meet_4_b=Hello, Cody. I'm Barry.
@cody_barry_first_meet_5_c=Do you want some food from a can?
@cody_barry_first_meet_6_c=I left some for later, but I can share!
@cody_barry_first_meet_7_b=That's sweet of you, but I'm not hungry right now.
@cody_barry_first_meet_8_c=Eating makes me happy, and I thought it would also make you happy.
@cody_barry_first_meet_9_b=Heh...
@cody_barry_first_meet_10_b=Is he your son, David?
@cody_barry_first_meet_11_a=No. We found him by a restaurant near here. I'll tell you all the details later.
@cody_barry_first_meet_12_b=Cody, you're a good kid.
@cody_barry_first_meet_13_c=I think I'll eat that food now...
@cody_barry_first_meet_14_b=Go for it.
@cody_barry_first_meet_15_b=Come on, David. Lead the way.

@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_caption=Killing a bandit
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_1_a=Hey.
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_2_a=Do you want to talk about what happened?
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_3_c=No.
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_4_a=Are you sure?
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_5_a=It must have been ... quite disturbing for you.
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_6_c=I don't want to talk about it.
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_7_c=You showed me how to do it.
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_8_c=How to pull a trigger. To hold my breath while doing so.
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_9_c=So I did just that.
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_10_a=Yes, you did. You did great ... and you helped.
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_11_a=I'm sorry. I shouldn't have demanded something like that from you.
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_12_b=Don't be so hard on yourself.
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_13_b=Cody would be dead if you hadn't taught him.
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_14_b=So he had to take a life, so what?
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_15_b=It's not like you don't have blood on your hands.
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_16_a=It's different! He's just a kid!
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_17_b=He is a kid who is alive, thanks to you.
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_18_c=Stop talking about that!
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_19_c=I don't want to think about it!
@dialogue_cody_killed_bandit_20_c=If I don't, then it's not real!

@cate_after_sidereal_burial1_1_b=Come on, David.
@cate_after_sidereal_burial1_2_b=We have to go.
@cate_after_sidereal_burial1_3_a=Farewell, friend...
@cate_after_sidereal_burial2_1_c=Goodbye, Cody.
@cate_after_sidereal_burial3_1_c=Goodbye, Barry...

@sidereal_silencer_1_a=A gun silencer? What is it doing here?
@sidereal_silencer_2_a=Maybe it's the reason there's a dead guy at the desk.
@sidereal_silencer_cody_1_c=Assassins!
@sidereal_silencer_cody_2_c=Do you think they are still here?
@sidereal_silencer_barry_1_c=That's a pretty terrible way to get fired.
