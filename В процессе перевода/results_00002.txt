@bandits_sufix=raiders

@r_d3_0_1a1=A group of raiders commanded by a man named Razor arrived by dusk. They weren't trying to hide, circling your hideout with their bikes, engines roaring, angry voices screaming.

@r_d3_0_1a2="Your time for slaughter has come, piglets," Razor himself shouted through a megaphone. "And I will be your wolf!"
@r_d3_0_1b1=You tried to escape, but Razor's men tracked you down. Your hiding place did not provide you with any defense. ^It was a slaughter.

@r_d3_0_2=Some of his gang was missing...

@r_d3_0_3a1=Two thugs found a fine bottle of whiskey in their supplies. How can you say no to an opportunity like that?
@r_d3_0_3a2=They were too drunk to move out and were left to sober up. They missed the whole party.

@r_d3_0_4a1=The dinner that day tasted weird. Some of the gang members complained about headaches and stomach troubles. One of them simply died, choking on his own vomit. Another two were unable to fight.
@r_d3_0_4a2=The poison neutralized 3 people in total.

@r_d3_0_5a1=When they found a guard shot in the head they had no idea who had done it.

@r_d3_0_6a2=He's probably still there, his brain splattered all over the pavement.

@r_d3_0_6b1=Sarge was about to talk with his men about leaving Razor's group when the poisoning happened.
@r_d3_0_6b2=One of the victims was his squad member. Sarge knew who put that poison there. The deal was off. It was time to seek revenge.

@r_d3_0_6c1=When the bandits moved out from their base, a small group split from them and went in the opposite direction.
@r_d3_0_6c2=Sarge wasn't brave enough to confront Razor, but he thought things through sufficiently. He and his four men never showed up to attack you.

@r_d3_0_7=men, including Razor, closed in to attack.

@r_d3_0_8a1=You placed a sonic mine near your hideout...
@r_d3_0_8a2=As Razor's men advanced, it went off - a sound undetectable to the human ear sent 3 of them into a long, deep coma-like sleep...

@r_d3_0_9a1=The attackers opened fire.
@r_d3_0_9a2=Bullets swooshed through the air. Some flew far too close to your head, decorating the walls of the house with numerous small holes.

@r_d3_0_10a1=Some of the guns didn't spit out any deadly projectiles. With a dry *click* they refused to work properly. Did someone meddle with their ammo supply?

@r_d3_0_14a1=You closed and locked the front door.
@r_d3_0_14b1=You closed the front door, however you forgot to lock it. Unfortunately for you, the raiders knew how to use door handles.

@r_d3_0_15a1=You closed and locked the back door.
@r_d3_0_15b1=You closed the back door, however you forgot to lock it. The raiders were able to simply open it...
@r_d3_0_15c1=You didn't close the back door...

@r_d3_0_16a1=You put solid metal bars in the ground floor window.
@r_d3_0_16b1=You tried blocking the ground floor window, but a simple knife stab was all it took to split your barricade open.
@r_d3_0_16c1=You didn't block the ground floor window...

@r_d3_0_17a1a1=With a clear way into your hideout,
@r_d3_0_17a1a2=bandits payed you a visit.
@r_d3_0_17a1a3=Cate managed to shoot one of them before she had to run upstairs.
@r_d3_0_17a1a4=Cate didn't even have enough time to shoot once. She had to run upstairs.

@r_d3_0_17a1b1=One remaining attacker - Razor himself - walked into your hideout.
@r_d3_0_17a1b2=Cate was waiting for him with a gun ready to fire.

@r_d3_0_17b1a1=While they were forcing their way in, Cate shot
@r_d3_0_17b1a2=of them with cold blood.
@r_d3_0_17b1a3=After that, she had to retreat upstairs as entry to the house was breached.

@r_d3_0_17b1b1=One remaining attacker - Razor himself - was trying to force his way into your hideout.
@r_d3_0_17b1b2=Cate simply opened the door and put her gun to his head.

@r_d3_0_18a1=Cody was nervously looking at a revolver in his hand. The gun wasn't big but in his case it looked huge and it weighted a tone. He practiced with you a lot that day. But was that enought for a 10-year-old to defend himself?

@r_d3_0_18a2=He aimed and pulled the trigger, trying not to look away as the recoil almost sent him to the ground.
@r_d3_0_18a3a1=One of the approaching bandits has slowly fell on his back, stretching his arms wide. In his last moments he couldn't accept the fact that he was killed by a kid.

@r_d3_0_18a3b1=Razor only looked down to check if the bullet had reached him and laughed when he found no wound. ^Cody missed. ^What Razor had not noticed, however, was your incoming punch.

@r_d3_0_18b1=Cody ran after Cate, screaming with fear.

@r_d3_0_19a1=Barry was holding his revolver near, waiting patiently for the bad guys. Then he just aimed and started firing.

@r_d3_0_19a2a1=They were advancing, though he was in a much better, defensive position. After a short exchange of fire, he managed to kill two of the attackers.


@r_d3_0_19a2b1=They were advancing, though he was in a much better, defensive position. After a short exchange of fire, he managed to kill one of the attackers. ^The other one, Razor himself, survived...

@r_d3_0_19a2c1=Razor was the only one that faced him. He had nothing to lose. With his entire gang gone, he just started shooting, running towards Barry.

@r_d3_0_19b1a1=Barry tried to stand in their way, using his fists.
@r_d3_0_19b1a2=He tackled one of them and hit him really hard after splitting his hands into a powerful sledge-hammer.
@r_d3_0_19b1b1=Barry, despite being unarmed, attacked Razor, jumping at him from behind.
@r_d3_0_19b1b2=They both fell to the floor, and Razor's gun fired...

@r_d3_0_20a1a1=With
@r_d3_0_20a1a2=bandits remaining, the situation didn't look good for you.
@r_d3_0_20a1a3=You were armed with
@r_d3_0_20a1a4=...
@r_d3_0_20a1a5=You took a few swings at them, managing to knock one of the raiders down.

@r_d3_0_20a1b1=Razor was the only one remaining.
@r_d3_0_20a1b2=You took a few swings at him, managing to knock him down before he could harm anyone.

@r_d3_0_20b1a1=With
@r_d3_0_20b1a2=bandits remaining, the situation didn't look good for you. You were holding a makeshift flamethrower, ready to fire.
@r_d3_0_20b1a3=It might have been a good weapon against animals or insects, but it wasn't as effective with humans. You managed to neutralize only one of the attackers.

@r_d3_0_20b1b1=Razor was the only one remaining. You were armed with a makeshift flamethrower, you were ready to face him.
@r_d3_0_20b1b2=It might have been a good weapon against animals or insects, but it wasn't as effective with humans. It was more the surprise than anything else that allowed you to overcome him. He was burnt just a bit, but that was more than enough for Cate to jump from behind at him, intent on strangling him.

@r_d3_0_20c1a1=With
@r_d3_0_20c1a2=bandits remaining, the situation didn't look good for you. Armed with a revolver, you prepared yourself for a gunfight...
@r_d3_0_20c1a3=Using all the rounds in the cylinder, you managed to hit
@r_d3_0_20c1a4=of the bandits.

@r_d3_0_20c1b1=Razor was the only one remaining. Armed with a revolver, you prepared yourself for a gunfight...
@r_d3_0_20c1b2=You exchanged a few shots, the noise of the bangs indoors almost rendering you deaf.
@r_d3_0_20c1b3=You both finally jumped from your covers at the same time, aiming at each other, each racing to be the first one to pull the trigger...

@r_d3_0_21a1=You had some spare bullets for the revolver on you. A wise choice, even if it was accidental.
@r_d3_0_21a2a1=With it you managed to shot one more thug, just as he thought you were out of ammo.

@r_d3_0_21a2b1=Razor was the last attacker left. He didn't expect you to have any more ammo. Oh how surprised he was when you aimed at him one more time than he anticipated you would...

@r_d3_0_22a1=The last
@r_d3_0_22a2=attackers advanced and you ran out of options. Cornered, surrounded, you had to fight.
@r_d3_0_22a3a1=Barry put up a valiant fight, but was shot after a short struggle with the attackers.
@r_d3_0_22a3a2=It was a fight Cody had no chance of winning. He was shot after a short struggle with the attackers.
@r_d3_0_22a3a3=You didn't manage to protect him. At least they were focused on him while you had time to act.
@r_d3_0_22a3a4=Filled with rage and anger, you barely remember what followed. You grabbed a weapon from one of the fallen bandits and started shooting. All the humanity in you was gone. Only revenge left. Revenge and despair.
@r_d3_0_22a3a5=Until they were all dead.
@r_d3_0_22a3a6=All but Razor...
@r_d3_0_22a3b1=There were too many of them. They were still armed.
@r_d3_0_22a3b2=You managed to tackle one of them, but Razor ruthlessly shot both you and Cate.
@r_d3_0_22a3c1=Razor was the last raider. His plan had failed. He knew his gang was over. This didn't make him less dangerous, though...
@r_d3_0_22a3c2=On the contrary. He had nothing to lose now, as he jumped right at you, with a mad look in his eyes.
@r_d3_0_22a3c3=In the final moment, Cate saved you by hitting him in the head with the back of her gun.
@r_d3_0_22a3c4=It was over.



@r_d3_1_1a1=As the day ended, black clouds pushed by winds from the east covered the sky, casting dark shadows on the ground below.
@r_d3_1_1a2=Loud thunder was sounding all around, preceded by sudden and sharp flashes of light. With them, the first rain drops fell on the wastelands.
@r_d3_1_1a3=It was not a life-giving water the dry land had been thirsty for. It was saturated with burning acid, as if Earth decided to clean its surface of life before the Moon did.
@r_d3_1_1b1=You tried to escape, but it didn't work out well for you. Acid rain and lightning strikes got you, leaving you no way to escape.

@r_d3_1_rod_1a=You made an improvised lightning rod on the roof.
@r_d3_1_rod_1b=That was a good call. Lightning struck the house, hitting it directly. If it wasn't for the rod, the roof would have taken a serious hit. This lowered the threat by 20%.
@r_d3_1_rod_2a=You didn't do anything to save the house from being struck by lightning.
@r_d3_1_rod_2b=It was bound to happen. A loud rumble almost blew your eardrums, and a large part of the roof was gone. Water poured in...

@r_d3_hatch_1a=You closed the roof hatch.
@r_d3_hatch_1b=That was a good idea. It stopped

@r_d3_hatch_2b=Not good. A lot of water poured in through the opening.

@r_d3_1_cody_1b=The kid drowned in the acid...

@air_sufix=% missing air

@r_d4_0=The world was ending. The Moon, cracked into pieces, was moving rapidly towards the planet, both celestial bodies pulling each other apart.
@r_d4_no_launch=You didn't make it. You weren't able to launch the ship in time to escape before the Moon destroyed everything...
@r_d4_launched=All systems green? Well ... some systems were green. You didn't have time to check every last nut or seal, like people did before launching rockets in the old days.
@r_d4_cate=Cate looked at you with her headset on. "Engine is ready. Initiating launch procedure. Overriding safety protocols. Manual controls engaged."

@r_d4_1=The acceleration force pushed you hard into your seat, squeezing all the air from your lungs. The rocket began its ascent.
@r_d4_cody_barry=You looked back to see Cody and Barry in their seats. It was truly a miracle to have them both here, a faint memory from another life echoed in your head.
@r_d4_cody=You looked back to see Cody in his seat. The kid had been through a lot, yet he was lucky enough to end up with you on this ride.
@r_d4_barry=You looked back to see Barry in his seat. Witnessing death and misery had caused his face to age decades since when you first met him.
@r_d4_cody_dead=The seat next to him was empty. You didn't manage to keep the kid safe...
@r_d4_barry_dead=The seat next to him was empty. At least you've kept the kid safe like the big old man wanted.

@r_d4_air_mixture3=Because the default setting had been corrupted, you were forced to create the air composition yourself.
@r_d4_air_mixture_0=Frankly speaking, you did a terrible job. The air reserves were barely breathable.
@r_d4_air_mixture_1=The composition was bad, but not terrible. You managed to breath with what was there, but it wasn't easy.
@r_d4_air_mixture_2=The composition was somewhat okay, but it could have been better. Breathing was hard, especially later on.
@r_d4_air_mixture_3=The composition was really good, providing you with enough air to breathe comfortably for most of the journey.
@r_d4_air_mixture_4=The composition was perfect. The air reserves sustained you for a long time.

@r_d4_fuel_mixture1=The ship climbed through the sky while Cate struggled with the engine's power...
@r_d4_fuel_mixture2=The vessel was gaining altitude. At least life support seemed to work fine.
@r_d4_fuel_mixture3=Because the default setting had been corrupted, you were forced to create the fuel mixture yourself.
@r_d4_fuel_mixture_0=Frankly speaking, you did a terrible job. The fuel was barely giving any thrust.
@r_d4_fuel_mixture_1=The composition was bad, but not terrible. The burning of fuel was giving some thrust, but it was far from efficient.
@r_d4_fuel_mixture_2=The composition was somewhat okay, but it could have been better. The fuel was giving you barely enough thrust.
@r_d4_fuel_mixture_3=The composition was really good, providing you with enough thrust.
@r_d4_fuel_mixture_4=The composition was perfect. Maximum efficiency meant a lot of thrust and a smooth ascent.

@r_d4_razor1=Razor traveled alone, bruised and hurt. Hearing a loud roar in the sky, he turned around and gazed up.
@r_d4_razor2=He silently watched you soar, clenching his jaw as hard as he was clenching his fists.
@r_d4_razor3=Looking around the wasteland he decided this place was as good as any other. He sat down and waited, looking at your ship going up and the Moon going down.

@r_d4_sarge1=Sarge and his men were standing on top of a hill. He traveled far west since you had last seen him. The whole squad raised their heads and gazed into the sky, tracing the bright light of your rocket.
@r_d4_sarge2="Would you look at that?" smirked Sarge, slowly shaking his head. "That kid actually did it."
@r_d4_sarge3="Good luck with whatever you find there," he added, before he turned away. The whole squad decided to open their last bottle of whiskey and drink it as the world around them started falling apart.

@r_d4_nav_inserted=You installed a navigation chip in the ship's systems.
@r_d4_nav_inserted2=With its help Cate was guided with a set of numbers, angles and coordinates, which is always better than just guessing.
@r_d4_nav_missing=Without a navigation chip Cate was piloting almost blind.
@r_d4_nav_missing2=Maintaining the right approach angle and altitude/speed without instructions proved to be harder than it looked.

@r_d4_lioh_filters_inserted=You inserted a fresh lithium-hydroxide filter into the ship's ventilation.
@r_d4_lioh_filters_inserted2=It absorbed the carbon dioxide in the air, making it more breathable.
@r_d4_lioh_filters_missing=The ship didn't have any kind of filter to get rid of carbon dioxide.
@r_d4_lioh_filters_missing2=As a result the air quickly became heavy and stuffy.

@r_d4_air_tanks_inserted=You installed reserve air tanks in the shuttle.
@r_d4_air_tanks_inserted2=When the regular air ran low, the reserves kicked in, providing you with more life-saving oxygen.
@r_d4_air_tanks_missing=There were no reserve tanks on board.
@r_d4_air_tanks_missing2=As the regular air began to run low, you really wished that wasn't the case...

@r_d4_calibrator_inserted=You installed a calibrator system on board.
@r_d4_calibrator_inserted2=It precisely calibrated all the engines, making them really well coordinated.
@r_d4_calibrator_missing=The engines were never properly calibrated.
@r_d4_calibrator_missing2=Cate did what she could, but it was a tough fight when one engine kept responding to her inputs differently than the other.

@r_d4_catalyst_inserted=You prepared a special catalyst for the fuel.
@r_d4_catalyst_inserted2=It caused the main rocket to burn fuel quicker, but it also made the reaction much more powerful.
@r_d4_catalyst_missing=There was no fuel catalyst in the tank.
@r_d4_catalyst_missing2=The regular fuel burning would have to do...

@r_d4_hull_inside_fixed=Good thing you noticed and fixed that crack in the ship's hull...
@r_d4_hull_inside_fixed2=Your repairs saved a lot of air from leaking out.
@r_d4_hull_inside_broken=A crack in the ship's hull is never a good sign.
@r_d4_hull_inside_broken2=After noticing how much air was escaping the cockpit, you managed to block it with something. But the damage had already been done...

@r_d4_hull_outside_fixed=Good thing you noticed and fixed that crack on the ship's fin.
@r_d4_hull_outside_fixed2=With your repairs, it proved to add almost no air resistance. Cate managed to compensate for the slight aerodynamic changes with her piloting skills.
@r_d4_hull_outside_broken=There was a crack on the ship's fin, a flaw ready to attack.
@r_d4_hull_outside_broken2=Cate was trying to overcome violent tremblings caused by the crack, struggling with the controls.

@r_d4_pills=You prepared some pills to temporarily enhance lung efficiency.
@r_d4_pills_you=You took one, and it reduced the amount of air you used during the flight.
@r_d4_no_pills_you=Too bad you didn't swallow one. Pills don't work when they just sit in your pocket...
@r_d4_pills_cate=Cate took one pill and, as a result, she used less air during the flight.
@r_d4_no_pills_cate=Cate didn't take any pills - her lung efficiency remained average.
@r_d4_pills_barry=Barry took a pill, and his lungs became more efficient during the flight, so he used less air.
@r_d4_no_pills_barry=Barry didn't take any pills, so he used a normal amount of air for a man of his size.
@r_d4_pills_cody=Cody took a pill, and it reduced the amount of air he used during the flight.
@r_d4_no_pills_cody=Cody didn't take any pills, so his lungs didn't work any better than they usually did.

@r_d4_no_air1="That's it ... we're not gonna make it. At this rate we will run out of air before we land."
@r_d4_no_air2=You remembered that there are space suits in the back. "It's time to use them."
@r_d4_no_air3="That won't be enough," said Cate. "They are for emergency use and only have air for a couple of minutes."
@r_d4_no_air4="It is an emergency," you argued.
@r_d4_no_air5="We have to move faster if we want to make it," decided Cate.
@r_d4_no_air6="I'll use some of the reserve fuel to speed us up, but we won't have enough of it left to slow down before landing."
@r_d4_no_air7="So hang on to something."

@r_d4_no_air_dead1=Seeing the air was running out way faster than it should, Cate pushed the throttle to the max, ignoring any safety warnings that filled the screens around her.
@r_d4_no_air_dead2=You also put on the emergency space suits, but they only had air for a couple of minutes.
@r_d4_no_air_dead3=The Moon was so close, yet so far.

@r_d4_no_fuel_dead1=Seeing the fuel was running out way faster than expected, Cate pushed the throttle to the max, ignoring any safety warnings that filled the screens around her.
@r_d4_no_fuel_dead2=It was your only chance to reach the Moon.
@r_d4_no_fuel_dead3=Too bad the ship wasn't prepared for such a rough ride. Shaken by the vibrations and heated by a not so ideal angle, it started to break apart...
@r_d4_no_fuel_bad=An explosion lit up the sky, only to quickly disappear. Soon there were much bigger explosions all around the globe.
@r_d4_no_air_bad=There just wasn't enough air on board...

@r_d4_no_fuel1="Чёрт. Дела плохи," сказала Кейт.
@r_d4_no_fuel2="Топливо на исходе, а нам ещё нужно совершить посадку."
@r_d4_no_fuel3="А этого не хватит?" вы спросили, указывая на один из индикаторов.
@r_d4_no_fuel4="Это для снижения скорости во время посадки," объяснила она.
@r_d4_no_fuel5="Но я не думаю, что у нас есть выбор. Придётся садиться на высоких скоростях."
@r_d4_no_fuel6="Держитесь."

@day4_normal=Вы долетели до орбиты, а оттуда до Луны оставалось всего ничего. ^Кейт направила корабль к лунной базе...
@day4_penalty=Вы долетели до орбиты, а оттуда до Луны оставалось всего ничего. ^Однако Кейт пришлось управлять кораблём на слишком высоких скоростях. ^Посадка будет не из приятных...
@day4_death=По крайней мере, смерть оказалась быстрой. ^Возможно, что-то могло бы предотвратить такой исход...?

@results_end=Нажмите, чтобы узнать итоги...
