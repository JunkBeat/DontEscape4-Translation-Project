@gasstation_newspaper1=Mon, March 12, 1996 ^^LUNAR EXPLOSION ^^The world is still in shock after yesterday's explosion that has left our Moon with huge cracks, visible to the naked eye from Earth. Scientists say that while it may look dangerous, there is no need for concern; the cracks are surface-level only, and the explosion will have no serious consequences.
@gasstation_newspaper2=The cause of the event is still unknown. Many point to one of the world's largest tech corporations, Sidereal Plexus, that was rumored to launch a mining operation on the Moon earlier this year. A spokesman from the company has denied those claims. "Yes, we were preparing to dig for Helium-3 this autumn, but I assure you we haven't even started."
@gasstation_newspaper3="Now, of course, the whole operation is going to be halted until further notice", he adds. ^Other experts believe the explosion was caused by an undetected meteor that crashed into the Moon. Whatever the case might be, the governments of the world urge people to remain calm.

@crashsite_body2_bugs_note=ATTENTION TEAM. ^ ^As of this week, we've been hired by the locals to help deal with a new kind of locust terrorizing the area. Perhaps we will finally use our Sonic Repellent Device. It fends off different kinds of insects - you just have to install it in the ground. But before you can start counting on it, you have to know exactly what type of insects you are dealing with and set the right frequency with the remote controller. I know this job sounds exhausting, and a bit dangerous, but at this point we need the food and fuel the locals are paying with.
@crashsite_body2_spiders_note=ATTENTION TEAM ^ ^As of this week, we've been hired by the locals to help deal with an outbreak of some variety of mutated spiders ... supposedly a result of space radiation or something. I know it sounds strange but it's real. Don't hope to get any super powers when they bite you, other than the power to lay paralyzed as they eat you alive. ^Anyway, we have some scent-repellents left in stock. James has identified which subspecies of those creatures will be discouraged by which scent. He probably wrote it down somewhere; just ask him.
@crashsite_body2_gas_note=ATTENTION CITIZENS! ^ ^As of today (1996-11-11) Civil Defense as an organisation is being disbanded. Evacuate the area or protect yourself on your own from now on. ^This region has been affected by highly toxic gas clouds. If you are unable or unwilling to evacuate, take cover indoors. Hide on the upper floor if the contaminated gas density is higher than normal air density. Otherwise, hide on the ground floor.^ Air density is around 1.61 kg/m3. ^God have mercy on us all.
@gas_note=Jeff,^You're new on the team, but I think you'll do just fine, despite what our boss says. Always remember to check the pH value of the toxin you're trying to neutralize. Mix two of our emergency response components and dissolve the resulting solution in a large amount of water.
@spider_note=Guys, if you manage to catch one of them check out their teeth. We have to make sure we use the correct repellent or otherwise it won't do anything.

@sidereal_xero_1=Patient: Nathan Harvez^ The patient has recently joined the Travelers team. With the first training finished, he was admitted to the practical part. Promising results. Sleep control at a level sufficient enough to visit other facilities in the near future.^ He is in good health, and all indicators are normal.^ His mental state is currently ... questionable.^ The patient feels strong anxiety after waking up, since the past few days he has been experiencing

@sidereal_xero_2=a feeling of someone's presence. This is probably due to a Seeing incident during the last controlled dreaming. ^Patient's testimony:^ ''It was there. Almost for sure. It stood in the shadow. It was looking at me. I did not see it at first ... but I felt it ... I could not move. I wanted, I tried ... but I was paralyzed. I was not even sure if I was still asleep or awake. Then it moved. No trained solutions helped. I lost control. So that's probably reality, right?

@sidereal_xero_3=If I could not do anything, it must have been reality. If so ... why was he there? I woke up, after all!''^ ^Recommendations: Conduct psychiatric tests again. Move the patient away from dreamers for an indefinite period. Prescribe sedatives. ^^The patient has also made a sketch of an encountered creature.

@sidereal_secrets_1=From: Jonathan Sampling ^To: Stephen Cervin ^ ^All the necessary preparations have been completed. We are ready to start the procedure. According to calculations, chances of success are at about 89%. As I mentioned in our last conversation, with current conditions I will not be able to get better results, and I think this is a risk we must take. At the moment we do not have much information about the Crystals and we're in

@sidereal_secrets_2=possession of a very small amount. We need more if we want our expeditions to continue, even if an attempt to synthesize more could end up a disaster ... This is more important than the existence of one world. Even in the event of failure, we will gain a huge amount of information that will allow us to increase the safety of the procedure in the future. SP-12119 is ... expendable. The level of development leaves much to be desired.

@sidereal_secrets_3=It is also one of the least profitable facilities. According to the instructions from the director of the SP-4, you should immediately evacuate. Mrs Stanford has a list of employees who should be informed about the evacuation if it is an actual necessity.

@conspiracy1_1=This issue's special report: SIDEREAL PLEXUS's Coma Clinic. Is it a real, legit clinic for people in a prolonged, comatose state? Or, perhaps, it's something much more sinister than that. We at Weekly Conspiracy believe there is something more to it than meets the public eye. So let's take a closer look at the mega-corporation's newest investment. Read more inside this issue!
@conspiracy1_2=SIDEREAL PLEXUS doesn't have to be introduced to anyone. Electronics, computers, automotive industry, space exploration - you name it. Their newly-opened facility doesn't look like another cash-grab by the corporation. A clinic for people in comas: if your loved one had the misfortune of falling into a coma, you might want some professional care for them.
@conspiracy1_3=Usually this kind of deal is super expensive. Sidereal Plexus's Sleeper Clinic, however, is dirt cheap. Why would a corporation focused solely on its own profits do something like this? People point out that this is just a PR stunt, an attempt to improve its image. While this is entirely probable, we don't believe it to be the truth.
@conspiracy1_4=As we all know, the truth is always hidden much deeper. Some families that decided to use the clinic - and who wish to remain anonymous to Weekly Conspiracy readers - report seeing their loved ones in public, walking around as if nothing had happened. Approached, they don't even recognize their family members, displaying totally different, alien behavior.
@conspiracy1_5=While the wake-up rate of people in comas is low in general, the reports of coma patients behaving like completely different people is unheard of. Could it mean Sidereal is using them for scientific experimentation? Brainwashing is one option, but we at Weekly Conspiracy have another possible and chilling solution: Sidereal Plexus is working on some sort of mind-transfer technology.
@conspiracy1_6=They are using people in comas as vessels for other consciousnesses, not interested in the well-being of the owner of the original body. They are just using them as "sleeves" of sorts. While this is totally speculative and we lack the necessary proof, we have been contacted by a supposed former clinic worker who confirmed our theory.
@conspiracy1_7=Unfortunately, all contact with that person has since been lost. We don't know who they were and whether or not they were being truthful. We will continue this topic in future issues of Weekly Conspiracy, so stay tuned and remember: THEY WANT YOU TO THINK WE ARE THE CRAZY ONES.

@conspiracy2_1=Last issue we investigated Sidereal Plexus Sleeper Clinic. While the problem still exists, and people out there are still being controlled by mind-transferring technology, we at Weekly Conspiracy began to wonder: Why does Sidereal Plexus have this technology in the first place, together with all their other advancements in space exploration, energy, and computers?
@conspiracy2_2=These days Sidereal Plexus seems to be first to come up with anything. To us, this seems just a bit too suspicious! They might have the best engineers in the world, but that can't explain how they are producing countless advancements, introducing many of them into our everyday lives. One can only wonder what fraction of their technology we are actually seeing.
@conspiracy2_3=Moore's Law states that processing power of computers doubles every 18 months, however since Sidereal opened their computer research branch two years ago, this increase has TRIPLED. This defies any logic and leads to an obvious conclusion: ALIENS. We at Weekly Conspiracy believe Sidereal Plexus has been in contact with extraterrestrial beings since its founding.
@conspiracy2_4=When you think about it, it's been in right in front of us this entire time - SIDEREAL, as in "stellar" or "astral"! It's pretty solid proof that their technology wasn't created on this planet. Whether by allowing alien spaceships to land in their secret facilities or by opening portals to other universes, they are importing this technology from an otherworldly place.
@conspiracy2_5=The real question is - what is the price they are paying? Let's hope we will never find out, because we at Weekly Conspiracy fear this price might hurt us all.

@outpost_faq_1=In case they have doubts, here's a FAQ: ^^Q: Why is it on the Moon? ^A: Even weak signals could corrupt our devices. The Moon's body shields our facility from Earth's intense radio interference. ^^Q: Is this a one-way trip? ^A: Yes. ^^Q: Where will we end up and in what state? ^A: A safe world will be selected. You are likely to survive intact.
@outpost_faq_2=Q: Who was selected for this rescue? Why is X not here? ^A: We had limited time and resources, and we could only bring as many people as we gathered since the incident. If you believe someone crucial to the operation is missing, please report it to your supervisor. ^^Q: Why are we only taking one ship? ^A: The other ship is a reserve/spare vehicle. Don't worry. We have directed our workers to multiple launchpad outposts - nobody will be left behind, as long as they present value to the company.

@cate_last_words_1=I write this in case something happens to me. David, you have to carry on - it's really important that you do what I say here. ^First of all, sorry for not telling you everything earlier. You must understand this whole thing is difficult to believe in, and I didn't want to overwhelm you with all this stuff. Secondly, don't panic, but there is no magical portal to the safe place.
@cate_last_words_2=All you'll find in the Moon base are Sleeper Pods. I have never been there, but they keep them all in a large room. It's probably hard to miss, even for a muff like you. The pods contain sleeping bodies, and yes, they will all be destroyed when the Moon falls. That won't matter, though, because the consciousness of each of those people has been transferred to a different place - a different universe, a different version of this world.
@cate_last_words_3=Probably a safe one where Sidereal didn't blow up the Moon. I know this is hard to swallow. I wish I could explain everything in more detail, but since I'm probably dead at this point, it won't be possible. Find the Sleeper Pods and send your consciousness elsewhere - this is the only way out. And I really hope all their systems are operational, because if they're not, you may end up in a world that is only an inch away from ours.
@cate_last_words_4=I think that's already happened in a parallel universe. That's why we were having all those dreams. We have memories from other versions of us. I'm not sure how it works, but I guess that's what happens when their system can't match you with an unoccupied body. Just my theory, though. Anyway, I'm writing this as you fix the ship, hoping that you will never have to read this. However, if you do...
@cate_last_words_5=I just want you to know I appreciate everything you did for me. I hope you make it. If you happen to find me in another universe, come say hi. ^Just kidding. It would probably freak me out. ^Don't stalk me, OKAY? ^Take care, David.^^Cate

@sideral_warning_note=I've made the calculations again. The instability ratio is too high. It can't work. We have to STOP the operation. ^We have to STOP IT OR CONSEQUENCES WILL BE CATASTROPHIC.
